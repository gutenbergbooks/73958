EDITOR.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is not a <i>treatise</i> that the Author announces;
it is nothing more than <i>Thoughts on the Mechanism
of Societies</i>. Such a title does not confine a
Writer to a regular plan; it saves him even the
risk of preparing his Readers for a chain of ideas
which cannot escape their sagacity if it exist,
and on which they cannot be deceived if it
do not. But in a picture consecrated to the
world at large as well as to his own Country, to
the People as well as to their Rulers, it was necessary
that the most striking object, the object
to which their first attention was called, should
be of so general an interest, as to entice them
progressively to an investigation of all those details
which deserve most to be scrutinised, and
of which the different relations are either little
known, or greatly mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p>The object which at present fixes the attention
of all the States in <i>Europe</i>, (all of them
either debtors or creditors), is the <i>National Debt
of England</i>, and the measures which will be
taken on that subject by the Assembly the most
clear-sighted of any in the world to every thing
that concerns the interests of the people, the most
jealous of its rights, and the most free, at least in
its debates. It is by considering that formidable
debt, and its influence on the wealth of the
State and the ease of the People, that the
Author dares to begin. But before he proceeds
to unfold the mechanism of the national debt, the
result of which developement presents some ideas
too opposite to the received opinion, he endeavours
by degrees to familiarise his Readers
with his own, by <i>some general reflexions on the
present situation of England</i>: these reflexions
leave him no room to doubt, that <i>England</i> was
in 1779, <i>notwithstanding the national debt</i>, richer
than she was at the beginning of this century;—richer,
either in a fourfold, or in a double proportion,
as the Reader is disposed to adopt the
one or the other rate of population: whence it
appears that the Author, in respect to his plan,
does not affix any importance to the difference
of opinions on this article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p><i>A more particular view of the subject</i> furnishes
him with fresh reasons, which seem to him
sufficient to quiet the mind of the most suspicious
creditor. It is, indeed, only by means of
the <i>savings</i> made, or daily to be made, upon
eight pence (the exact proportion each individual
is entitled to in the general revenue), that
it has been possible to reach the summit of opulence,
and that it is possible to be fixed there:
but the Author seeks for such <i>savings</i> in agriculture
and industry, as cannot be misunderstood;
he observes that the savings made in agriculture,
have proved sufficient, in the course of a century,
not only to discharge all the public burdens,
but even to double the landed revenue; and
he then enters into a detail of several objects, (all
easy to be ascertained,) which seem to demonstrate
a similar progress in industry.</p>

<p>Here our Author, beginning to feel himself
on ground sufficiently firm, confesses that he sees
nothing in the present situation of <i>England</i>, tending
to justify the idea of a national bankruptcy,
although the public news-papers often hint at the
convenience of such a measure. The author even
so far forgets himself, as to examine <i>seriously</i>, whether
it would be profitable or unprofitable to
effect the so much recommended <i>reimbursement</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
<i>even on the supposition that the 238 millions which
have been borrowed, and have disappeared, could
find their way back to the Exchequer</i>.</p>

<p>After having presented the question under
several points of view, our Author hesitates not to
declare for the negative, and then endeavours to
prove that a previous <i>thesaurisation</i> which might
have enabled the nation to go through the last
war without laying any additional tax, would
have done more harm than the new taxes can
possibly have done.</p>

<p>The Author, become bolder because he meets
with no contradiction when he is alone, (and
indeed he is alone very often) undertakes to
reconcile mankind to the taxes by means of a
first decomposition of the impost; he gives up,
it is true, one part of it as burdensome, (it is
truly to be lamented that this part cannot be
dispensed with; luckily it is the least); but he
contends boldly for the other part, as a very
precious resource for that portion of the people
which best deserves to engage the cares of Government.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the precautions taken by
the Author not to frighten his readers, there remains
such a leap for him to clear, that he is seen,
as it were on his knees, begging he may be permitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
to try twenty times, if he cannot clear it
in ten: in other words, he earnestly wishes that
his work may not receive its final judgement before
it has been perused to the end; and in fact,
it is not impossible but that a detached proposition,
the absurdity of which is striking when
considered singly, may be found conclusive
when successively brought near to all those that
are to follow it.</p>

<p>An Editor owes more to the Public, than to any
work, even such as he could wish to bring into
some trifling repute: I think then, it is my duty
(<i>in foro conscientiæ</i>) to declare, that it will not be
till the Reader has perused fifty pages or more,
that he will suspect the reason why the Writer has
not announced in the very first, some singular
opinion, which he meant insidiously to establish
as it were step by step in his pamphlet; but, at
length, we begin to have some notion of what
we are to expect from a man who has been trying
to wheedle us into a belief, that <i>taxes are a
trifling evil;—that <span class="upright">thesaurisation</span> would be a very
great one;—that a reimbursement is at best useless</i>;—and
who afterwards modestly intimates, that
some singularities may perhaps escape him <i>in the
sequel</i>; as if it were possible to imagine any thing
more singular than the three propositions I have
just quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>Yet too much severity should not be used. Has
the Reader been but amused with the part of
the picture hitherto exposed to his view? Let
him humour the Author in his little conceits.
Who would exhibit for public entertainment, if
he were not at liberty to draw up the curtain in
his own way; if he had not a right to display,
at every shifting of the scene, that part only of
his curiosities upon which he meant for that instant
to fix the eyes of the spectator?</p>

<p>But if the Reader, in spite of the different
positions into which he has been attracted, has
not observed the least alteration in the compass;
if he has not been moved by the arguments with
which he has been lured before he came to that
part of the work—let him throw the piece into the
fire; for the Author, of whom I do not pretend to
imitate the circumspection, or adopt the fears,
or justify the temerity, or share in the guilt,
aims at nothing less than to induce <i>all Europe</i>
(all <i>Europe</i>!) to investigate,</p>

<p class="center"><i>1st</i>,</p>

<p>Whether it could possibly cost <i>England</i> more
than 5 millions sterling, (<i>found once for all</i>)
to secure <i>for ever</i>, in the most solid manner,
the payment of the interest on a debt of 238<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
millions, that interest rated at 9 millions, of
the same currency?</p>

<p class="center"><i>2dly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether there be not, (without its being
suspected), in the system of finance in <i>England</i>,
some of those imperfections so well remarked,
so fully, so bitterly criticised in that
of <i>France</i>; and whether a national reimbursement
be not the easiest of all the sports a Minister
of finance can think of, to amuse society without
serving it?</p>

<p class="center"><i>3dly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the possibility of a balance of trade,
<i>always favourable</i>, be not as doubtful as the necessity
of a national bankruptcy, and the advantage
of a national reimbursement?</p>

<p class="center"><i>4thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether an equilibrium in all things (and
every where), be not indispensable; and whether,
to maintain or restore it, any great effort of imagination
be required on the part of those who
fancy they hold the balance?</p>

<p class="center"><i>5thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the difference of prices be something
or nothing; and whether more has been wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
by the <i>French</i> than 66 millions <i>Tournois</i> (<i>found
once for all</i>), to secure <i>for ever</i>, the interest at
<i>5 per cent.</i> on a national loan of 1,500 millions
<i>Tournois</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>6thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the monster of a competition (in
point of trade) supposed unconquerable on account
of the low prices with which it should be
armed, be not as fantastical as that of a balance
always favourable?</p>

<p class="center"><i>7thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the most justifiable premium for exportation
be any thing more than one piece of
injustice, become necessary to counterbalance a
great many others?</p>

<p class="center"><i>8thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether it do not result from the ever infallible
and merely mechanical restoration of an
equilibrium in all the prices, that the taxes are
in themselves completely innocent;—whether
there be more than one kind of taxation, which
increases only by the exact amount of the tax, the
whole mass of prices;—whether the effect of
taxation be not trebled by all other imposts;—whether
the most pernicious of them, (after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
poll-tax), be not the tax on luxury;—and whether
from the instant that all kinds of taxes,
either judiciously or injudiciously contrived,
have re-acted on every thing, the burthen
of the national debt is not literally <i>null</i> in all
countries?</p>

<p class="center"><i>9thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether, <i>after monopoly</i>, credit be not that
effect of wealth which increases most the price of
every production, both of agriculture and industry?</p>

<p class="center"><i>10thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether a certain country, where smuggling
has been prohibited under pain of the galleys,
be not indebted to smuggling itself for one
fifth of the products of her agriculture, which
the merchant and trader turn to their advantage
with as little scruple, as if they had not petitioned
for the detestable law against the smuggler?</p>

<p class="center"><i>11thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the absurdity of the general opinion,
on the most efficacious means of establishing a
profitable competition, in point of trade, be not
clearly evinced, by the account of a strange revolution
in <i>France</i>—a revolution, as indubitable
as the two wars in 1755 and 1779?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>12thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the impossibility of the two supposed
balances, constantly at the disposal of <i>England</i>
and <i>France</i>, be not proved, by the very facts adduced
in both countries to establish the existence
of those two monsters?—Whether that impossibility
be not demonstrated by other facts as
little equivocal; and whether it be not the
interest of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> to renounce the
Idol, and solemnly abjure both its works and its
pomps?</p>

<p class="center"><i>13thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether imports and exports be not a mere
sport, as innocent as the game of tennis?
A sport, nevertheless, which all Governments
might turn to great profit, all Subjects to
great advantage, and all States to an increase of
power and wealth.</p>

<p class="center"><i>14thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the generality of exports from <i>England</i>,
at different periods, considered with regard
to her foreign correspondence, do not demonstrate
a kind of electricity, unthought of hitherto,
though not unworthy of amusing the greatest
politicians at their leisure moments?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>15thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether the trifling jest of luxury be not
equally as innocent as the diversion of exporting
and importing; and how much the most fastuous,
the most profuse, the most sensual of all monarchs,
consumes, above the most avaricious of
all his subjects?</p>

<p class="center"><i>16thly</i>,</p>

<p>How much (not counting shillings and pence)
<i>England</i> has lost, when her right-arm, as her colonies
were called, was lopped off; and how
much (not counting shillings and pence) <i>Europe</i>
might lose by losing her sovereignty over both
the <i>Americas</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>17thly</i>,</p>

<p>Whether all that had appeared to the Author,
as founded in reason and equity, do not finally
prove (in spite of the general conspiracy of all Nations
and all Ministers) to be strictly conformable
to the most stubborn facts;—and whether it do
not result from that mass of facts and reasons,
that the Author’s assertion, the most interesting
to mankind, (that is, to all Princes and their
People) is not of the most irrefragable truth,
and a truth the most easily brought within the
reach of all the parts interested therein?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span></p>

<p>I, though merely Editor, shall venture still
further;—I shall suppose the result of this combination
of facts and reasons to be, that the
means hitherto devised as the most proper to
alleviate the burdens of the people, were the
best devised to oppress them: What matters it to
the people, provided they are to be oppressed no
longer? What is the time past, but the baseless
fabric of a vision?</p>

<p>I shall likewise suppose, that from those facts
and reasons it should result also, that never was
a decrease in the Prince’s revenue more effectually
secured, than by the contrivances devised to
increase it: What is it to the Prince, provided it
be no longer possible to mistake the true means
of enriching him?—Is it not the time to come,
that should, above all, engross the attention of a
Great Prince?</p>

<p>I shall again suppose, as another result, that it
has been a mistaken notion, to imagine that the
revenue of the People must be lessened, in order
to increase that of the Prince:—What is that to
the Prince—what is it to the People—provided
both be now convinced, that it is not possible to
enrich the one, either really or nominally, without
enriching the other in the same manner, and
in the same proportion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span></p>

<p>I shall further suppose, that it should evidently
result also, that in the Administration of the
finances of any country, there is not, there has not
been a single principle, nay, not a single idea
worthy of the name: What is this to the Ministers
who now hold that department?—Can
they command what is past? And is it not the
redressing of abuses, when discovered, that constitutes
the true glory of a Ministry?</p>

<p>To crown the whole, I shall even suppose, that
thence also should result, to a very insignificant
individual of <i>America</i>, a little sprig of that <i>European</i>
shrub called Bay-tree:—What would that
signify to all the Ministers, all the People, and
all the Princes in <i>Europe</i>?—Will <i>America</i> consume
less <i>European</i> goods, or will she produce less
gold and silver, for having produced an idea?</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE</span><br>
MECHANISM of SOCIETIES.</h2>

</div>

<p>The first step that led to civilisation was,
probably, some kind of slavery, whatever might
be its nature. It seems impossible that the
strongest and most industrious, following no
other impulse than that of a consciousness of his
superiority, should have come to the noble resolution
of sharing generously, with the weak
and idle, the fruits of his own labours and industry;
nor can it be supposed that he could
suffer any one, but himself, to pronounce on the
prerogatives due to his courage and his abilities.
But the most consummate knowledge of the
means which may have paved the way to despotism,
would throw but a faint light on the various
subjects which I propose to take under consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
The Epoch which it may be useful to
dwell upon, is that, wherein the chiefs of the
different states, being in no anxiety for an authority
which is no longer contested, are the first
to acknowledge its limits, and begin at last to
be solicitous for the happiness of their subjects.</p>

<p>Such, in my opinion, is now the prevailing
system all over Europe. The advantage of true
freedom is fully felt, and its influence over all-commanding
wealth universally acknowledged.
But, in order to compare the inferences with the
principles, to appreciate the measures by their
effects, I shall fix upon that Nation whose
avowed maxims, and best known circumstances,
are most likely to furnish me with a train of arguments,
without having recourse to any further
suppositions but such as may appear necessary
to clear up the facts that will be adduced in support
of those arguments, and to render the
consequences, to be deduced from them, more
lucid and pointed.</p>

<p>I shall begin with the most interesting article
in the present situation of affairs, namely, how
far the wealth of a State, and the affluence of the
Subject, may be affected by a <span class="smcap">national debt</span>?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading2"><i>A general View of the present State of <span class="smcap">Great
Britain</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Mr. <i>Arthur Young</i>’s valuation of the Revenue,
in his Political Arithmetic, is the result of his
own private observations. Nothing ever occurred
to me on the subject, that can come up
with the minute accounts he gives us of the different
provinces which he has visited in the
north, south, and east of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>I am ready to suppose, with that gentleman,
that the joint revenue of <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>
may be computed, the landed produce and
commercial profits included, at 110 millions
sterling.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Chalmers</i> has published a work on the
comparative resources of this country at different
periods; a subject, it seems, difficult to
touch upon without examining the state of
population. This publication, according to
my judgement, unites to such solid principles as
the matter will admit, a great deal of propriety
in the manner of applying them, and of drawing
the inferences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>I willingly acquiesce, taking it for granted,
with the author, that <i>Great Britain</i> contains
9,350,000 inhabitants: but, at the same time, I
apprise the reader, that I do not mean to take any
advantage of a population more or less numerous;
nor of a larger or smaller amount of the
revenue. <i>Data</i> I require; but such I will prefer
as most nearly border on reality. There is
not a State to which, with a difference in the
numbers, one may not apply what I have to say
concerning <i>England</i>, in those which I have
adopted.</p>

<p>It appears from the estimates of Mr. <i>King</i>,
who, in the reign of <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>, proved
himself as exact an observer as Mr. <i>Young</i>
has done in our days, that the produce of Land
alone amounted then to 32,000,000; the latter
calculator nearly doubles it, by rating it at
63,000,000. The Custom House books, the
exactness of which cannot be disputed in one
of the two facts they vouch to, (<i>the Burthen
of the Shipping, and the Produce of Exportation</i>,)
will shew that the former, from the year 1709 to
1773, progressively increased from 289,318, to
775,078 tons; and the years 1697, 1698, 1699,
taken upon a medium and compared with 1771,
1772, and 1773, tend to prove that the gradual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
rise of the Exports has been still more considerable,
being from 5,612,058<i>l.</i> to 16,027,937<i>l.</i>
(Vide <i>Sir Charles Whitworth’s State of Trade</i>).</p>

<p>The foreign trade of <i>England</i> seems therefore
to have trebled since the beginning of the present
century. We shall, in the sequel, state the reasons
for supposing the commerce of other nations
to have experienced the same progression.</p>

<p>The annual sum of 110,000,000, divided
amongst 9,350,000 inhabitants, will produce
daily little less than 8 pence per head, from the
Monarch down to the meanest subject.</p>

<p>The observations I have made in several parts
of <i>France</i>, from documents, it is true, no ways
comparable to those of Mr. <i>Young</i>, could not
justify my allowing so large a revenue to each individual
in that kingdom. Yet <i>France</i> and
<i>England</i> are the two richest and most flourishing
countries in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Young</i> rates the clear profits of the Manufactories
and Trade of <i>England</i> alone at 37 millions;
but as these two objects have apparently
been trebled in regard to the exports, they cannot
be supposed to have exceeded 12 millions in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the reign of <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>. To this let us
add, in a proportion rather exaggerated, 5 millions
for the landed and commercial revenues of
<i>Scotland</i>; and it will appear, that, including the
32 millions of landed produce, as computed by
Mr. <i>King</i>, the total amount of the revenue, land
and trade of both countries included, could
hardly be equal to 49 millions in the beginning
of the present century. Now, from the same
author, both kingdoms contained at that period
7,200,000 inhabitants, who, if admitted to a
brotherly share, would have claimed only 4½<i>d.</i>
each per day. I do not confine myself to a
nicer exactness in the fractions: the object is
not to calculate the precise instant of an eclipse;
or at least, that of English prosperity appearing
to me no ways probable, I think myself justified
in neglecting every thing that might impede my
operations, without influencing, in the least,
my arguments.</p>

<p>Yet the wages of a journeyman were nevertheless
rated then at 8<i>d.</i> per day: but let it be observed,
that the number of working-days, when
balanced with the holidays, sickness, and want
of employment, those eight pence, distributed
in the journeyman’s family, were often reduced to
two; just as the sixteen pence, the present price<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of labour, according to Mr. <i>Young</i>’s Estimate,
commonly amount to 4<i>d.</i> only, although the
brotherly share of each man nearly amounts to
8<i>d.</i> If any one should be inclined to call this, injustice,
let him consider that this very multitude
of reductions from 4<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> and from 8<i>d.</i> to
4<i>d.</i> from <i>William III.</i> to this present time, has
been the only means of accumulating by degrees
that immense stock of 600 millions and upwards,
manifestly laid out by the State in less than a
century, and of which the National Debt makes
a part. It is evident that if each individual,
from <i>William III.</i> had only spent at the rate of
5<i>d.</i> per day, there would be no National Debt;
but as each man of the nation could, generally
speaking, and upon an equal proportion, lay out
only 4½<i>d.</i> per day, the exceeding halfpenny
must have long ago swallowed up the whole principal,
the produce of former reductions.</p>

<p>Not one of the monuments erected since that
period would now exist, nor would a single
trace be left of the stocks to which the nation
owes its present wealth: each portion of the
national stock, every monument posterior to that
era, prove as many persons reduced in the
origin from 4<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> and then from 8<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i>
as either of the above two sums are oftener told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
in the value of such monument, or such stock as
might be made the subject of inquiry. No
country in the world can boast of a more respectable
source of its opulence.⸺This opulence
must either be given up, or the inconveniences
that attend it be submitted to. In all
parts of the world the labourer earns a livelihood,
and very little above that: yet this very
trifle is sufficient to make him happy, wherever
he cannot be compelled to work without
pay. He feels little, never takes the trouble of
thinking, and leaves off work only to eat, make
merry, or go to rest.—Is our lot better, with
that fatal degree of reflection by which our whole
life so often centers within a single point?</p>

<p>But is the nation in general as happy in our
days as it was in those of <i>William III</i>? Have
those causes, which tend to produce a decrease
in the population, no manner of influence on
the people’s happiness? And is not the reality
of such causes more self-evident, than the pretended
proofs adduced universally in favour of
its increase?</p>

<p>Without entering into any dispute on the
merits of the researches concerning population,
which would lead to some truths perhaps unthought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of hitherto; here follow the arguments
which will occur to any man who stands not in
need of a fixed and precise number of thinking
heads, laborious hands, and well-digesting stomachs.</p>

<p>1st. It is not easy to conceive how, the landed
revenue being nearly double, there should be
a less number of husbandmen; for it is not with
agriculture as we find it in several manufactories,
where the invention of engines, and an
alteration in the mode of working, can so advantageously
supply the supposed decrease in the
number of hands to work after the primitive
manner. The valuable number of husbandmen
seems therefore, in my opinion, placed beyond
even the idea of a decrease.</p>

<p>2dly. It is no less impossible to imagine, that
the number of sailors being nearly in a triple
proportion to what it was, and the quantity of
exports probably augmented on account of the
burden of the outward-bound ships, a diminution
should have taken place among that class of
people, equally precious to the State, for establishing
and ascertaining its wealth and strength,
as the cultivation is indispensable to secure and
support its very existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>3dly. If, notwithstanding the acknowledged
impossibility of proving a real decrease in the
population, any one should obstinately admit of
it, without positive proofs, it cannot at least be
denied, that the produce of land and industry
being nearly doubled, some means must have
been devised, to do that with one hand which
required two before. In this case it would be an
easy matter to prove, that at the rate of the supposed
depopulation, the few elect, who have
escaped its causes, can boast of enjoyments in a
threefold proportion to what they were before,
notwithstanding the difference between the present
impost and that which was paid in the beginning
of this century: for, after all, the taxes
under <i>William III.</i> amounted to four millions
and a half and upwards, to be deducted from
forty-nine millions standing revenue; the balance
was therefore forty-four millions and a
half, to be shared amongst 7,200,000 inhabitants,
acknowledged by Mr. <i>King</i>; that is, very little
above 4<i>d.</i> per day for each individual. Now,
in the year 1779, for I have not yet exceeded that
period, the impost was of about nine millions,
which, taken from an income of 110 millions,
left a surplusage of 101,000,000<i>l.</i> to be divided.
If we adopt the supposed depopulation at its
highest rate, the number of souls in <i>England</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
reduced to 4,500,000, each of whom has
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> instead of 4<i>d.</i> allowed in the reign of
<i>William</i>. It is then incontestible that the
Nation is richer, but, I must own, not more
happy; for they complain and are alarmed at
this time, as was then the case.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to allow the supposition
of an increase, if the intention were to shew that
the people are now in a worse condition: nor
could even this be deemed sufficient; for, admitting
the existence of 9,350,000 inhabitants,
it will appear, that, by the surplusage of 101
millions left, after the discharge of the taxes in
1779, each individual would be entitled to 7<i>d.</i>
instead of the groat, in <i>William</i>’s reign.</p>

<p>The nation therefore in that year, in spite
of its public debt, had almost doubled its
wealth, rating the population at 9,350,000;
and raised it four-fold, supposing the number
reduced to 4,500,000 souls: and in either case,
the riches of the State, as well as the national
debt, arose and increased from the daily reductions
of 4<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> and of 8<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> which,
since the reign of <i>William</i> to this day, have
escaped from that all-devouring canker, commonly
called <span class="smcap">Luxury</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading3"><i>A more particular View of the same Subject.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>I wish to inquire more minutely, whether
such facts as are known do not cast a sufficient
light over all the others in general, to induce
the most anxious and pressing creditor, and
the nicest in point of proofs, to sleep in the
utmost security, till some particular discovery
pleads in justification of his alarms.</p>

<p>The present revenue of <i>England</i> is stated at
63 millions; that of <i>Scotland</i>, at about 7 millions;
collectively, 70,000,000<i>l.</i> It will be seen hereafter,
that 65 or 75 millions would give the
same essential results: I must however add, if
any thing more should be wanted, that, in his
estimate, Mr. <i>Young</i> does not include the horses,
hemp, flax, vegetables, fruit, nor hops, &amp;c.
all of which are reproduced annually, and augment
considerably the number of exchanges
held out to industry.</p>

<p>This landed revenue is produced by somewhat
more than one third of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>It remains for us now to compute, at the
lowest, the income produced by a second class
of people, probably as numerous as the former,
since not less than 1,500,000 persons of both
sexes, and of all ages, are employed solely in
preparing and working the wool. (See <i>Chalmers</i>’s
Estimates.) But if the labour of 3,000,000
of husbandmen brings in 70 millions annually,
why should that of an equal number of mechanics
and handicraftsmen stand for less in the
computation? To this reason let the following
remarks be added.</p>

<p>Out of the 70 millions, 20 come to the share
of the cultivators, either as the price of their labour,
or for poor’s rates; 12, of these 20 millions,
at least, are laid out for the produce of industry:
bread, it may be observed, is comprised
in the remaining 8 millions.</p>

<p>Let us state the number of proprietors at
2,000,000, including all their dependents,
under any denomination whatever, women,
children, chaplains, farmers, physicians, strollers,
servants, &amp;c. and their annual expenditure,
in the rough produce of the land, at 18
millions, there remains only 32,000,000, which
must be paid by the industry, already in advance,
of the 12,000,000 exchange granted to the cultivator.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
It is obvious that I speak here only
of that kind of industry which may be productive
of exchangeable commodities, even against
those of foreign produce.</p>

<p>Three millions of mechanics do not live more
soberly, nor are they worse clothed, than the husbandmen:
it may therefore be inferred, that out
of the 20 millions, which they likewise receive
for their labour, they lay out in the produce
of industry, 12 millions, which, added to the
44 millions I have just mentioned, make, all
together, 56 millions.</p>

<p>The manufacturers and principal traders, under
every denomination, with their dependents
of all kinds, complete the necessary number of
the supposed population of 9,350,000 inhabitants,
that is, 1,100,000 souls, themselves, the
idle people supported by them, and their household
included. Supposing their consumption of the
rough produce to be proportionable to that of the
proprietor, their expenditure will be 10,000,000;
but then we must square by the same rule what
they lay out for the produce of industry: 18
millions will be the sum, which, together with
the other 56 millions, makes a mass of 74, instead
of the 70,000,000 acknowledged in agriculture.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Even this would not be sufficient, for reasons
which I shall give in the sequel; but I shall observe,
in the first instance, that were the population
less numerous than we have supposed it to
be, the same consumption of the rough produce
is certainly inadmissible: but the landed
revenue remaining the same, though procured
by a less number of hands, it would then become
necessary to estimate the amount of the labours
of industry, effected by a number of handicraftsmen,
equal to that of the cultivators, from
the ascertained value of the latter’s productive
labour.</p>

<p>I now return to the <i>deficit</i> wanted for the
security of a constant increase of wealth, which
may at all times supply all the exigencies of the
State.</p>

<p>The 18,000,000 consumed on the produce
of industry, as granted to the principal traders,
seem to raise them to 4,000,000 above their
real value; I mean, that which is acknowledged
in the produce of agriculture. It is not under
colour of the supposed interest of the enormous
principal, which gives motion to the manufactures
and to the inland trade; it is necessary
that industry should contribute its stock, as well
as agriculture. The principals laid out, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
one or the other, are a matter of indifference to
the state; it can speculate but on their produce,
and pays exactly the interests, when it rates at
the same value the result of the labours of both;
but, to the 70 millions assigned as the indisputable
produce of industry, (supposing a laborious
man to be as good as any other equally
industrious) we must add the intrinsic value of
the rough materials on which industry hath
wrought: This accession, which is also fair and
equitable, will furnish, not only the 4,000,000,
which annually exceed the home consumption
just mentioned, but likewise all the millions necessary
to secure, and mean while explain, this
gradual increase, which it would be difficult not
to trace in trade, as it is observable in the
landed property. The latter is doubled within
the space of 90 years; from whence we are forced
to conclude, that the annual savings of the farmers,
and owners living on the spot and cultivating
their estates on the true principles of husbandry,
have sufficed to discharge, not only the
public burdens, and to defray the manuring
expences, but also to double the produce and the
general means in the most important article. It
remains now to examine, whether the savings of
the manufacturers, traders, and other supporters
of industry, are as indisputable as those made
by the cultivators.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading4"><i>Clear Savings of the Manufactories, Trade, and
other Branches of Industry.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The riches of a country, and its progress,
are established and confirmed by its savings.
Let us consider cursorily such as, from their
self-evidence, admit of no dispute.</p>

<p>Ninety years ago the landed revenue of
<i>Great-Britain</i> was computed at about 35 millions.
Let us suppose that 10 millions of specie
were then required to give an effectual circulation
to property of all kinds, (many people
will think this by far too little<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>): but the
revenue of landed estates, being now 70 millions,
20 millions at least, instead of the 10 millions
requisite in the times of <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
should be allowed; and consequently a first clear
stock of savings amounts to—10,000,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The consumer in those days was probably
allowed, as is still the custom, a twelve-month’s
credit upon half the articles purchased.
Some of them took a longer time, if others a
shorter one; but the stock of credit being then
equal only to 35 millions, and now raised to 70
millions, we have clearly another mass of savings
of—35,000,000.</p>

<p>Then, as in the present time, the preparing,
manufacturing, and delivering, required six,
twelve, or eighteen months. Let us suppose the
year, upon an average of the slowness of one
operation, and the celerity with which another
was performed, we shall find again, in the difference
of the flock, a third saving of 35,000,000.</p>

<p>If we suppose the value of manufactories,
dwellings, warehouses, and all kinds of establishments,
necessary to answer all the exigencies of
a stock of industry and commerce of 35,000,000,
to have amounted then to 25,000,000, we must
admit that the objects in the same manner
necessary to a stock of 70,000,000, do likewise
present us with a fourth clear saving
of—25,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>In order to employ those hands by whose
labour the annual sum of 35,000,000 was produced,
10,000,000 were probably sufficient;
whereas 20,000,000 are now required. This
shews a fifth clear saving of—10,000,000.</p>

<p>The annual returns from the <i>American</i> islands
was computed, 90 years ago, at about 330,000,
(Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>’s State of Trade).
Half of this produce was, in all likelihood,
mortgaged to commerce; but it only supposed a
stock of 3,000,000 at most lent, it matters not
at what interest. The yearly produce of those
colonies, added to that of the ceded islands,
amounts, at present, to more than 2,900,000;
more than one-third of which belongs to the
trader, either as purchaser or mortgagee, and
exhibits a sum of about 20,000,000, from which
we shall substract the former 3,000,000; and
considering (for a moment) those colonies as
being foreign to the State, we shall find a sixth
clear saving of—17,000,000,
(the petition of the merchants in 1775, supposes
it to be 30,000,000.)</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> might perhaps be out of humour
with me, were I to suppose that the continent
of <i>America</i>, stands on the debtor side, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
no more than 4,000,000; I shall therefore set
down this article as—<i>Memorandum</i>.</p>

<p>Eighty years ago the amount of exportation
from <i>England</i>, was estimated at 5,612,085<i>l.</i> In
1773, upon a medium of three years, the same
was increased to 16,027,937: of the exceeding
9 or 10 millions, one part appropriated to the
commerce in <i>Europe</i>, another to the <i>American</i>,
a third to the <i>East-India</i> trade, remain one,
two, and sometimes three years, before they
can be applied to the same objects. These
10,000,000 therefore suppose a stock more than
double the same sum, and ought, in consequence,
to be set down as a seventh clear saving
of—10,000,000.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> ships, employed eighty years ago
in carrying on the national trade, presented only
a sum of 289,318 tons burden; the number of
tons is now rated at 775,078. This increase of
485,760, together with the expence attending
the fitting out, going and coming, produce a
stock of 5,000,000, which must be doubled, by
compensating the voyages of six and eight
months, by those which require two or three years:
here, therefore, appears an eighth clear saving
of—10,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The proprietor of lands should not be considered
in this light, in the use he makes of his
yearly profits, but with respect to that part of
his said profits which he lays out in cultivation:
In regard to that share of his income
which he invests in the funds, we must consider
him as member, agent, and usufructuary of industry
and commerce. Now, if we divide into
three parts the whole of the national debt, one-third
of which, if agreeable, we shall set down
as foreign property, and the other two as belonging
to the natives, we must of course acknowledge
in the nation a new sum of clear
savings, amounting to 180,000,000. This, in
fact, should not be considered as a real increase
of wealth, which it is at all times easy to appreciate,
but as a proof that there exists, in the
nation, an inestimable number of men, who are
capable, in the space of ninety years, to effect a
saving of 180,000,000, which government will
have it in its power, within the same space of
time, to appropriate to the exigencies of war,
if potentates should continue in a warlike humour;
or to lay out in objects of industry and
cultivation, supposing an improvement of the
revenue should be preferred to a state of warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>I shall not speak either of the difference which
may be observed between the present state of
the Royal navy, and the situation it was in at the
beginning of this century, nor of the public monuments
erected from that period, nor of the <i>India</i>
territories, nor of the Colonies remaining to <i>England</i>;
provided the objection concerning the money
due to foreigners is not repeated against me, as I
am in hopes, by and by, to find some kind of compensation
for it. I shall therefore confine myself
here, to observe, that the above savings of all
kinds of industry, some of them active, the others
passive, all equally necessary, assisting each other
mutually, no doubt, and finally amounting to
332 millions, have been effected in the course of
90 years; not with any sensible detriment to the
landed property, since its revenue is doubled,
nor to the disadvantage of the lower class of
people, whose day-work brings in 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> instead
of 8<i>d.</i> nor to the prejudice of the fine arts, the
rewards of which are perhaps fourfold, comparatively
speaking; but solely according to the
common course of things, <i>restrained, nevertheless,
by a war of 30 years and upwards, out of
the 90</i>, and by all the prejudices which the
present generation begins to shake off, and which
probably will be entirely abolished in the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>It is no ways natural that the same causes will
not be productive of the same effects. It may
therefore, in my judgement, be reasonably concluded,
that, within 90 years from this day, the
landed revenue may be increased to double its
actual value, and the population, trade, and
industry, augmented in the like proportion,
were even the national debt to amount then to
476,000,000, instead of the present 238,000,000,
which excites so many complaints and loud
murmurings.</p>

<p>In fact, let us suppose the debt arrived at a
height so apparently formidable, <i>and the price of
every thing proportionably increased</i>; would the former
be less firmly established? Methinks that
the very contrary is demonstrated by calculation,
and that imagination cannot frame any rational
objection thereto; at least I am free to confess,
that all my efforts have not been able
to produce any combination of probable circumstances,
which might, in any supposition,
justify the dread of that <i>application of the sponge</i>
which is so often held out as a resource that
sooner or later must be adopted. Setting aside
the infamy of such a measure, what advantage
would accrue from it? Let it be adopted this
moment in <i>London</i>, within three days the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
step must inevitably be taken at <i>Paris</i>. A manœuvre
of this kind would manifestly indicate
either the most hostile intentions on the part of
the <i>English</i> government, or the project of overturning
the constitution: the latter concerns
<i>England</i> alone; but in the former, <i>France</i> is
deeply interested. That power would be compelled
to put itself in a situation to oppose an
immense and free revenue, to a revenue equally
immense without appropriation. Were, on the
other hand, the <i>French</i> to lead the way, <i>England</i>
must inevitably follow; and the unprofitable
disgrace would be the portion of either of the
two nations that should have set up the precedent.</p>

<p>But who will see without grief, 2,000,000 interest
due to foreign States! 2,000,000 in specie carried
out every year from <i>England</i>! <i>England</i> yearly
stript of 2,000,000 of her money!!! It will
be seen hereafter in what that money consists.
Yet with personal stocks so real, so considerable,
so clear, what can prevent <i>Great Britain</i> wresting
from the foreigner, the share he claims in
the national debt? The reason is obvious: the
owner of landed property, or the farmer, who
hopes to get six <i>per cent.</i> of the stock which he
lays out upon his lands, instead of vesting them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in the funds, envies not the foreigner who is
glad to get 5, 4, or even 3 <i>per cent.</i> On the
other hand, the merchant who trades by commission,
and who has an opportunity of placing
in the colonies his money at 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest,
which is raised to 8 and 9 by his commissions for
sale and purchase procured therewith, cannot
wish himself in the situation of a stranger,
whose stock in the <i>English</i> funds brings him
in, not above one half of that sum. It is still less
an object of envy for the manufacturers, or
owners of ships, who, from their manufactories
or shipping, clear 10 or 12 <i>per cent.</i> of the monies
laid out by them: the projectors of all kinds
likewise flatter themselves, that the stock employed
in their undertakings will produce 15
<i>per cent.</i> To sum up the whole in much
fewer words, the prospect of 3 or 4 <i>per cent.</i> is
not likely to tempt any one, who is in hopes of
getting a two, three, or even four-fold interest.
And in fine, the public funds, in any country
whatever, will never be more or less than a
lucky, <i>or rather a providential</i>, resource for those
who have neither talent, power, nor leisure, to
place their money to better advantage.</p>

<p>Now, would the abolishing of such a resource
turn to the profit of the State, even supposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
it to be effected by the justifiable means of a
general reimbursement, were the case possible?
I have too often reflected on the subject, too
often revolved it over and over, I have viewed
it under too many points, not to be sensible how
far above my strength it is to discuss the matter
in all its parts; I shall nevertheless venture to
throw out some thoughts, which to me seem
likely to render somewhat problematical a question
which, at first sight, does not appear anyways
difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>This question is not, whether it would be
more advantageous to the State, not to have
contracted a debt of 238 millions; but whether,
since it is incurred, it would be profitable to
discharge it. To doubt of the former, would
be absurd: 238 millions thrown away almost
entirely, within the space of 90 years, to forward
destructive schemes, now no otherwise
compensated than by a double devastation of
the same kind, in a neighbouring kingdom,
which by a treble population was able to support
it, would certainly have been better bestowed,
in both countries, either on the lands, whose
revenues and number of cultivators would have
increased, or in the improvement of the trade
and arts, the stock and <i>chef-d’œuvres</i> of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
would thus have been multiplied. But the
debt being once incurred, let us suppose that the
238 millions, which are vanished, should return
into the Exchequer, would it be proper or
not to pay it off? Thus stands the question.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading5"><i>Thoughts on Imposts and Reimbursements.—The
Accumulation of public Treasure considered as
the Means of preventing Taxation.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The present impost in England, as the case
is almost every where, consists of two parts
widely different from each other: the one is
certainly burdensome, but necessary;—of this
hereafter. Might not the other, which concerns
the national debt, however grievous it may
appear, be considered as an useful establishment,
so long as it shall be presumed that the increase
of the national wealth, and its being divided
amongst a greater number of individuals, is an
advantage to the State; “or, in other words,
until it shall appear evidently, that the welfare
of the State requires that each of its members
should lay out annually all that he is able to
spend?” Before I attempt to deliver my
opinion on these two subjects, I shall suppose
the reimbursement possible, and resolved upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Nine millions of taxes, to pay off the annual
interest of the debt, compose nearly one seventh
of the landed revenue. These taxes, gradually
laid on such objects of consumption as are
supposed most likely to bear them, must have
raised their price by one seventh, or something
more; and that really, justly, and I think
necessarily. The reader will perceive that I
speak of the objects of taxation collectively,
since some of them bring to the Exchequer
twice their intrinsic value. The reimbursement
being effected, would they fall back to their
primitive value?—Yet this must be, in order to
reap the pretended advantage; and this, in my
opinion, would be of no manner of service.
I shall endeavour to prove it; and then we
shall examine whether the effect would not be
more than doubtful.</p>

<p>It would be no easy matter to assign, for certain
general facts, any other cause than the
force of Nature; who, in the end, gets the
better of all the regulations that thwart her.
But let any one examine whether there be a
single untaxed object, which, from 90 years
back, or, to speak more to the purpose, from
the origin of the national debt, is not raised
more than one seventh, above the nominal value<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
it had at that period. It is therefore sufficiently
probable that the taxes have been felt,
not only by the consumer of the taxed commodities,
(according to the laudable intentions of
Government) but also by the whole nation, by
all the individuals that compose it:—And this,
in my opinion, is equally just and unexceptionable.</p>

<p>Yet, it may be urged, that this increase in
price is to be ascribed to the greater quantity
of specie in circulation. Granted. In this
case, a falling-off in the prices, accruing, as
it is supposed, from a decrease in the taxes,
which is represented as the effect of a reimbursement,
cannot then take place:—besides,
as the sequel will show, the taxes unavoidably
bring in, one way or the other, even
in the first year, the whole money required to
pay the same. I shall argue on both suppositions.
Is the increase in the prices owing to
the taxation? It appears, evidently, that the
taxes bring in the sums necessary to pay them,
since they are actually and annually paid:—This
money, then, must be withdrawn from the
circulation, in order to lower the prices. Is
this increase the effect of an augmentation of
the specie? Then it will be necessary, in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to ascertain the primitive price, to recall from
the circulation all the money which has been
introduced since, and in spite of the taxes.
Now if, in spite of the taxes, a country
abounds with money, how should it not be so,
supposing no duties had been laid?—How can
the abolition of the taxes prevent the introduction
of cash?—How will it come to pass,
that the mass of specie being increased, the
prices shall not be raised?—And if all of them
augment, in a fair proportion, who will gain
by it, who will suffer?</p>

<p>Be it supposed, nevertheless, for this is my
main object, that the abolition of the taxes
will lower the price of the mass of taxed commodities.—The
same force of nature, which,
without the intervention of any one, had raised
the generality of untaxed objects up to the
rate necessary to balance the imaginary value,
which the tax added to the others, would
operate in a contrary sense, and diminish, insensibly,
the price of those articles which might
have been overlooked:—What would be the
advantage accruing to the State from a general
and proportionable decrease?—Let us not think
yet of the pretended profit that would result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
therefrom, in favour of trade, with relation
to foreign competition: this matter requires
a particular article. The only business now
in hand, is to examine, whether, in case the
reimbursement should be effected, this general
decrease of prices, which I have just granted,
could be effectually obtained.</p>

<p>The reflections which I have hitherto laid
before the reader, suppose that the refunded
238 millions would irrevocably be transferred
from the Exchequer into the hands of those
unfortunate individuals who might have been
forced to receive their reimbursement. But
one must live. Government could not carry
injustice so far as to compel them to bury, or
cast into the deep, that precious metal, ripped
up at so great an expence from the bowels of
the earth. What consequence would then ensue,
if that immense sum put into circulation,
not in <i>England</i> alone, where such an addition
of specie would, in less than six months, occasion
a six-fold rise of prices, but over all
<i>Europe</i>, where probably treble that stock
never was in circulation?—The price of
every commodity would treble, or at best double,
perhaps universally.—What advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
could the State, or individuals, derive from
such unavoidable, general, and proportionable
rise?—Were the reimbursement practicable, instead
of effecting it, I should vote for laying
out the 238 millions in erecting a colossus of
gold and silver, to be a standing monument of
public gratitude towards those whose œconomy
and confidence have served the State in its
needful circumstances.</p>

<p>The absurdity which might be imputed to
such an idea I shall partly do away, by stating
the effects of laying up treasures, as has been
the fancy of several princes, and which is
supposed profitable by Mr. <i>David Hume</i>, who,
methinks, ought to have been one of the first
to rest assured of its inutility, after his excellent
observations on money.</p>

<p>I shall suppose that the <i>English</i> government
had preserved, seven years ago, the 60 millions
and upwards, expended during the last
war; and that, instead of laying those taxes so
highly complained of, they had annually laid
out of the Exchequer, the 12, 15, 20,000,000
sterling, which successively produced the last
debt: what might have been the result?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>First, If the very useless prohibition of the
exportation of specie, however it <i>might</i> be profitable
to those who could export it, could have
possibly been put in force, 60 millions of real
cash added, in a country where 20 millions
perhaps are sufficient for circulation, must have
doubled at least the price of every thing; a consequence
diametrically opposite to what it was
intended to effect. Would it not, in some
respect, have ruined the Bank, by rendering
useless its nominal stock, in lowering the interest
of its real one, and reducing, in fine, its abilities
so much below the level of public wants, when
the general prices, two-fold increased, would
have raised, in the same proportion, that of every
engagement?</p>

<p>Secondly, The evil would have been less fatal
than I describe it, if the prohibitory law,
as all those that militate against justice and
common sense, had been evaded; but the gold
hoarded up heretofore, and now supposed to be
circulated over <i>England</i>, would, by succession,
have passed into <i>France</i>: and the latter, in order
to continue the war, would have borrowed, even
of the <i>English</i>, at four, and presently at three
<i>per cent.</i> the monies which she could not
procure at less than seven or eight <i>per cent.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Now money growing more common in <i>France</i>,
the prices would be, as in <i>England</i>, and soon
after every where else, increased in the same
proportion; for it is essential to observe, that
those two nations are too rich, their correspondence
too extensive, their activity kept up by too
many branches of industry, for them not to regulate
the markets all over <i>Europe</i>: it is probable
that both are now too enlightened any longer
to refuse receiving it, not one from the other, but
from Nature herself, who, constantly provident,
ever above the reach of untoward regulation, at
all times unbiassed in bestowing her favours, or
equipoising one by the other, would settle, only
a little later, notwithstanding all efforts to the
contrary, that equilibrium necessary to the general
good of Society, of which it is glorious
enough for those two countries to constitute the
preponderant parts.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Independent of this general and inevitable
repartition of the 60 millions laid up
heretofore, the 10, 15, and 20 millions, which
<i>England</i> has found yearly, during the last war, in
the purse of her subjects, were, beyond doubt, that
portion of capitals, which the circumstances of such
a war as the last was, would have rendered useless
in the hands of the lenders, had government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
found in the Exchequer those sums which were
obtained by way of a loan. Can it be doubted
but that this portion, useless in <i>England</i>, in the
supposition of a prior accumulation of money,
would equally have been sent into <i>France</i>, on
the first prospect of placing it to advantage?—It
would have been carried there, just as the <i>Dutch</i>
had formerly sent into <i>England</i> the dormant part
of their capitals, and would send it any where, at
all times when sure of benefiting by it, were it
even against the interest of the <i>United Provinces</i>,
saying with <i>Camilla</i>, in <i>Corneille</i>’s Tragedy of
the <i>Horatii</i>,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It will appear by the sequel, that I am as far
from cutting off such resources, as are deemed
infallible, and dictated by prudence, in order to
support with vigour a necessary war, as I am
from raising the least doubt concerning the right
of waging war, be it ever so unprofitable and unjust.
My only intention was to prove, that
treasures hoarded up in time of peace, and scattered
afterwards during a war, in order to avoid
taxation, would raise much higher the prices of
everything, than taxes of any kind whatever could
raise them. And I do now say—make war as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
long as you please, but do not accumulate for the
purpose of waging it. Your monies, locked up
in your strong chests, could not be sheltered
from every kind of accidents; and whilst you
can boast of subjects equally brave and industrious,
you will never want money, nor means to
carry on any war you may undertake: but
then you must submit to that augmentation of
prices, which must naturally follow. I flatter
myself I shall be able to prove, that this very increase
is subject to no manner of inconvenience.</p>

<p>Which part of the impost is truly hurtful
to the wealth of nations? A standing army of
50,000 men in time of peace, both for the sea
and land-service, and 50,000 more employed,
either upon the different objects relating to
those services, or to maintain good order and
public tranquillity, or intrusted with the collection
of the revenue, are evidently 100,000 men,
taken in <i>England</i> from that last class which,
though <i>last</i> in point of rank, is nevertheless the
sole instrument of the national riches. Now,
out of the <i>given</i> number of 9 millions of inhabitants,
6 millions only constitute this precious,
this productive class; the other 3 millions consist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
merely of consumers: from the 6 millions,
allowed in the productive class, deduct 4 millions
of children, old people, and women, half of
whose life is taken up with the cares and incumbrances
of a domestic nature; of this truly profitable
class 3 millions only will then remain. A
hundred thousand men, all stout, vigorous and
skilful, constantly withdrawn from that class,
occasion a vacuum of about a twentieth in the
productions of the land, and of the arts, that is
to say, (for there should be no illusion in the
case) the twentieth part of the possible wealth.
That portion of the impost, which is set apart
for the subsistence of those 100,000 men,
is therefore, in some manner, burdensome;
since society is thus deprived, not only of
the produce of their industry, but also of
that part of other people’s labour which they
consume without contributing towards it: but
amends are amply made for those indispensable
privations, by the property being better secured,
and enjoyed in full tranquillity. Besides, that
part of Society, which suffers most thereby, does
not belong to the productive class; the latter, as
has been already observed, is, in the richest as
well as in the poorest countries, ever reduced
to that pittance which is but just necessary to
keep up industry. Nations the most free differ in
this point from those who groan under the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
slavish despotism, only by the insolence with
which this scanty pittance, if refused, is insisted
upon in a free country, and the humble manner
in which it is sued for in the others. The difference
of natural talents, displayed in their
utmost energy, suffices to establish, sooner or
later, amongst the freest people, that enormous
disproportion of wealth which gives offence elsewhere,
only because it is not always the proof or
reward of labour, abilities, and œconomy.</p>

<p>Let any circumstance whatever, either well or
ill judged, occur, which may determine the nation
to complete to 200,000 the 50,000 sailors
and landsmen that are sufficient in time of peace;
150,000 more men will be taken from the productive
class, which must, of course, occasion
a second vacuum, viz. the productions with
which they would have enriched or amused their
country. But the loss will not end here; other
300,000 men, many more perhaps, from the
same class, constantly busy, during the war, in
preparing the intended destructive plans, will
unavoidably occasion a farther loss of four or
five other twentieths in the other enjoyments of
peaceable times, to which, had not other occupations
interfered, they would have contributed:
and if the war should last for 3, 4, or 10 years, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
evident that, in the latter supposition, the nation
must lose all that increase of wealth which would
have been effected, had the principal, swallowed
up by the war, been differently employed. This
loss is considerable, immense, and never can be
retrieved; for what was then omitted, will never
be done; what will be effected, might equally
have been so, without preventing the productions
which would already have taken place.</p>

<p>All these <i>deficits</i> in wealth, occasioned by the
war, are a substantial loss; and the prospect would
be dispiriting indeed, were not the rival nation in
the very same predicament. But will this grievous
loss be after the peace active, as it were, and felt
by the community longer than the time required
for the 2, 3, or 400,000 men, employed
during the war in forwarding the destructive
schemes, to resume their peaceable occupations;
or till the number of them, who shall have died
in <i>America</i>, the <i>Indies</i>, of the scurvy, or at the
fatal tree, be replaced by the ordinary course of
population?—This I cannot conceive by any
means: some of the reasons, which I have to
adduce, will be found in the reflections I am
about to present on the second part of the impost,
which seems to me not less useful than the
first is necessary: all my other arguments will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
appear in the other parts of this work. If it
can be concluded from the <i>ensemble</i>, that all the
evils brought about by a bad or ill-fated administration,
are naturally, and without expence,
compensated under a wise ministry, and that the
most barbarous and most extravagant of them
all could have no other means of ruining the nation
than by destroying the people; then, made
easy on the effects of the national debt, we shall
have courage enough to acknowledge, that it is
as sacred in the hands of those, who, having
furnished the value, are in possession of the
vouchers, as the crown on the head of the
monarch; and we shall enjoy the freedom
of mind necessary to infer, that although
Providence often seems to leave to chance
the destiny of some individuals, yet it is very
far from being indifferent to all that concerns
the whole species<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading7"><i>Of that part of the Impost, which is more useful
than grievous.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The part of taxation, which now remains
to be considered, is that which, at every instant,
presents to any one, a secure and useful
employ of all the capitals at his disposal, and
of all the savings which prudence hath induced
him to make. The utility of the public funds,
which are nothing else but the national debt,
might seem established by these few words; but
further details are necessary.</p>

<p>I have adopted the estimate by which <i>England</i>
is supposed to contain 9,300,000 inhabitants;
one-third cultivates the land, one-third is engaged
in manufactures, and of the remaining
third, 600,000 at most share among them the neat
produce of cultivation and the arts, in proportion
to the capitals with which they keep in play
those two engines of opulence. All the remaining
part of the people, as dependents under
whatever denomination, look, for their subsistence,
to the friendship, humour, pride, or wants
of the 600,000 proprietors.</p>

<p>Out of 70 millions, at which the landed revenue
throughout <i>Great Britain</i> is computed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
33 millions are absorbed by the unavoidable expences,
and accessary charges attending cultivation,
or annexed to the property. The
proprietors share among themselves 20 or 25
millions; the other 12 millions go through
the hands of farmers, as a very equitable recompence
for their trouble, and as a liberal interest
for a personal stock of 120 millions necessary
to the produce of the revenue. (Vide Mr. <i>Arthur
Young</i>.) On the best use possible of these last
120 millions, solely depends the increase of
landed profits: but it is only by degrees, and
the concurrence of favourable circumstances,
that the landed property can effectually receive
the increase of the capital, which is calculated
to augment that produce.—Does it conduce to
the interest of the State, that, till then, the
farmer should keep inactive the capital appropriated
to so material an object, or that he
should lay it out to improve the lands before it
is wanted, or that, waiting for the instant of
need, he should employ it in such manner as
not to have it at command when the needful time
is arrived?—This question cannot be answered,
I think, but in the negative; and it appears to
me, that, on this point at least, I may assert
positively, that an establishment, which puts into
the hands of the farmer, at the very juncture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
when he wants it, that portion of his capital
which had hitherto been useless, <i>and which
however was, till then, (owing to such an
establishment) advantageous to some one else</i>, is,
of all others, the most profitable, wherever the
object is, to give to every capital that degree of
activity and utility of which it is susceptible.
Therefore, a reimbursement which would deprive
the <i>capitalists</i>, farmers, and active proprietors,
of a resource equally safe and profitable,
would not only prove fatal to the order
of citizens especially interested in the landed
revenue, but to all those who, whilst the money
intended for the improvement of land, is
unapplied, make use of it in some advantageous
speculation, which becomes important to the
arts, and to commerce.</p>

<p>We have already observed, that out of the
three last millions of inhabitants, 600,000 <i>capitalists</i>
only share among themselves the neat
profits of the arts, and of cultivation. There remain
therefore 2 millions 400,000 dependents,
who look up, for their subsistence, to the caprice,
the pride, or wants of those opulent men.
Now out of that number of dependents under
every denomination, servants, clerks, lawyers,
physicians, &amp;c. several thousands are to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
reckoned, who, tired of their situation, put by
constantly, part of the wages of servitude, in
order to secure to themselves and their posterity
a more free and less equivocal existence.—Would
the State be benefited, were this class
of men, as essential as any other parts of society,
to bury, as it were, the surplus of their layings-out,
till they should have amassed the sum they
might think sufficient for their intended purpose?—Would
not the money, thus lying idle,
occasion a chasm in circulation, which would
turn to the prejudice of trade, thereby deprived
of part of its resources?—Besides, if the want of
a chest, safe from the attempt of robbers, and
other inconveniences, a chest which is not only
a security for them, but affords an interest for
the money therein deposited, should necessitate
them prematurely to embark in some scheme foreign
to their occupation, which must be either
abandoned or neglected: would not that knowledge,
which they have derived from experience
in all matters relating to their primitive avocation,
be entirely lost to the public?—A reimbursement
therefore which would deprive that
part of society, much more wretched and dependent
than either the mechanic or the cultivator,
of a resource which, from its certainty,
induces the former to fulfill with more zeal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
exactness, the duties they have imposed on
themselves, would prove a measure as hostile to
humanity, as it would be contrary to sound
policy.</p>

<p>In the immensity of commercial operations,
how many capitals to a considerable amount,
unemployed during two, three, four, and six
months, are indispensably wanted at the precise
period! Would it turn out to the advantage of
the State, if a considerable capital, useless for six
months to the holders, and for the like space of
time essentially wanted by those who possess none,
should lie dormant in the proprietor’s chest, till
time should give it life, and make it useful?</p>

<p>But it may be urged, a man buying stock
in the public funds, would lend to the seller
(were no such funds established) the sum which
he gives for his purchase.—That he might do so,
there is not the least doubt: But could he depend
on receiving the money at the time appointed
for the repayment? May not the best
man to-day, be a bankrupt to-morrow, and break
for a million; and if the enterprise, to the execution
of which a merchant appropriates, to
be paid in six months, that portion of his capital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
which till then has been to him unprofitable,
should require that punctuality which alone
could insure its success, will not prudence compel
him to give up six months interest, that his undertaking
may not be left entirely to chance?—Will
not the public have lost the fruit which might
have been reaped from that dormant capital, had
the owner been at liberty to dispose of it?—And,
will the same public flatter themselves that the
six months interest which the merchant was
obliged to sacrifice, in order to secure the execution
of his plan, will not be reckoned in
the expenditure?</p>

<p>Some will say, with no small degree of acrimony,
“How many drones are supported at the
expence of the public funds! These are only an
encouragement to idleness.”</p>

<p>But do the persons before spoken of, come within
this description? And, if the man who has laboured
in his youth, chooses to repose himself in
his old-age, is this pretended idleness any thing
more than that <i>otium</i>, that leisure, so justifiable, and
so sweet, after a toilsome life, when the state of the
mind, and of the heart, cease to make labour necessary?—And,
supposing, that after his death
his wealth devolves to an ideot, must the son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
an industrious father, who has served the State
both by his œconomy and labour, be deprived
of his resource?</p>

<p>It might be objected, that my reasoning derives
its force from the bare supposition of a
total reimbursement, the possibility of which
no one can admit; but were it subjoined, that,
by acknowledging the impracticability of the
measure, we suppose its expediency;—were it
farther said, that the public papers have often
spoken of, and do still point out as the readiest and
surest way to effect it, <i>the application of the sponge</i>;—were
it added, that the first geniuses of <i>England</i>,
<i>France</i>, nay, of all <i>Europe</i>, have advanced, and
do still maintain, that such a measure will one
day or other become unavoidable;—then we
should be forced to acknowledge, that it would
be no inconsiderable service to humanity, to
spare no endeavours to convince the people,
that no greater ease, power, or happiness,
would accrue to them, were the nation to resolve
upon its own disgrace.</p>

<p>Nor would it, in my opinion, be a more
difficult talk to prove, that from a real and gradual
reimbursement, no other advantage could
result, than bringing about by degrees and more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
imperceptibly, an evil which would prove equally
unprofitable to all.</p>

<p>I set aside the outcry against the interest
yearly paid to foreigners, as the produce of the
sums vested by them in the funds, because I
think ruin impossible, where the money borrowed
at 4 or 5, is laid out at an interest of
6, 7, or even 10 <i>per cent.</i> I likewise overlook
the declamatory complaints on the fate of
the handicraft and husbandman; because the laws
of <i>Lycurgus</i> should be revived, or the government
must confine itself to protect those two classes
of men against every sort of private vexation,
and to secure to them the trifling salary to
which they are every where and forever doomed.
In spite of avarice the salary must be raised,
if the prices of every necessary should increase;
and were these to fall in their value,
mutiny itself could not prevent a diminution of
wages.</p>

<p>That part of the people which truly deserves,
and should engage the attention of government,
is that crowd of dependents, in the other class, of
which I have already spoken: like the cultivator
and artificer, they have no other stock than the
passions and wants of the <i>capitalists</i>. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
would be much more wretched than the others,
if the education they have received, carrying
their thoughts constantly and in spite of themselves
beyond the present moment, government
should in a manner compel them to center them
all within that narrow space. The merchant
never has more in the funds than that portion of
his capital, which, for the moment, is useless
to his trade. The farmer, and the proprietor
who manages his own estate, <i>considered under
these two heads</i>, have at no time in the funds
more than that portion of their capitals, the actual
use of which upon the lands they cultivate,
might turn rather to their prejudice than profit.
The annihilating of the public funds, or, in
other words, a partial reimbursement, a gradual
discharge of the debt, could therefore affect
those three orders of stockholders no farther than
to deprive them of this way of increasing their
capitals, without running any risk; and those are,
undoubtedly, the smallest part of the sums which
constitute the national debt. Which is, then,
the order of citizens that receives the larger
share of the interest funded for that debt? It
is that multitude of dependents whom the political
œconomy of society has doomed to toilsome
occupations useful to that society, or to
laborious studies, of which that very society<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
daily reaps the benefit: it is to that multitude
of widows and orphans of both sexes,
whose future support the unfortunate class above-mentioned
thought to have secured by means of
the present privations which they had imposed
on themselves: it is to those children whose
elder brothers are in possession of all the family
real estate, and whose parents hoped to have
fixed their condition and settled their fortune
by the only means that can effectually obviate,
not the injustice of an unequal division, since
it is admitted, but the inconvenience resulting
from the indivisibility of the landed property,
which devolves to the eldest.</p>

<p>Yet if, in a State, we must be father, brother,
sister, widow, orphan, <i>capitalist</i>, in
fine, or without a capital, but with the faculty
of acquiring one; which, then, is the class of
citizens interested in paying off, either totally, or
in part and by degrees, the national debt, when
once it is incurred? Besides, if the reimbursement
cannot be effected but at the public expence,
what advantage will the public derive
from this operation?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading8"><i>Objections of another kind against paying off the
National Debt.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The nominal amount of a loan which nothing
obliges us to repay, is a matter of a very little
importance; the interest agreed upon for the
borrowed sum, is the only thing that deserves attention.
The total of the interest in <i>England</i>
is now about nine millions, three millions of
which could not be procured but by laying
taxes on those objects which had hitherto escaped
the penetrating eye of the financiers,
and by doubling or trebling the impost on
those which appeared less liable to the inconveniences
attending such an additional increase.</p>

<p>Before I examine in what mode the taxes
operate, I shall suppose, for the satisfaction of
the sensible and benevolent mind, that this formidable
burden falls only on the consumer of
such objects as are taxed. The only plausible
aim of a reimbursement, is a diminution of
the taxes which lie so heavy on that consumer;
but the misfortune is, that the only
means of refunding, is to devise new taxes, or
increase the former ones. Besides, if this increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
be trifling, the reimbursement cannot be
effected in less than a century. I freely confess,
that in this case, the proprietors of the public
funds would be less aggrieved, having then sufficient
time to think on the less disadvantageous
modes of replacing their stock; yet, I repeat it,
not less than a century would suffice to discharge
that very debt; and the public being a little
more burdened annually, than they would have
been had not the project of paying off the debt
been started, would have no other compensation
for the additional burden, than the distant
prospect of a general release in a hundred years.—If
the intention is, to bring about that release
within a period which, to the fiftieth part of
the present generation, gives the hope of enjoying
the effect of it, I agree, that by means of one million
of additional taxes, and some financiering
tricks, the whole debt may be liquidated within
the space of 40 or 50 years; and then, that part
of the present generation which may exist at
that <i>most gracious</i> period, will, perhaps, bless
the hand by which it shall have been relieved.
But would that same hand be, till then, entitled
to the like blessings from the unfortunate who
should be reimbursed, and from those at whose
expence this operation would be effected?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>A first difficulty attending the objects under
examination, is, that on every head requiring
an explanation, a multitude of questions occur,
which must be previously discussed; yet, with
the utmost candour I confess, that there is not
one among them which is not above the extent of
my abilities. I shall therefore offer my thoughts
on the subject with all that diffidence which
results from such a consciousness. Partly
by chance, partly from some other circumstance,
as little glorious almost, or as little humiliating,
I have been so often in the right, and
so often in the wrong, that I should not be now
more surprised at the one than proud of the
other.</p>

<p>Another inconvenience is, that a picture,
which, in its <i>ensemble</i>, might hold out, through
a thousand incorrections and as many essential
defects, a grand subject which, to become generally
interesting, seems to wait only for the
pencil of a skilful artist, viewed, unfortunately,
by pieces, (and indeed it cannot be viewed
otherwise,) presents at each time, nothing but
a singularity, an oddity, which will cease to be
so only when brought near to another; and this
last, nevertheless, will require the same indulgence
in order to its being rightly understood. The picture
which I have presumed to take in hand is, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
think, nearly of this kind. My wish, and a bold
one it is, would be, that no judgement be pronounced
on any of the particular parts, till they
have been seen all together; for there are but
few of them which, till another has been examined,
is not liable to very just objections: and
under each head I have answered to those only
which it was essential to refute, that the reader
might be able to go through the whole of the exhibition,
which, had the plan of it been presented
in the first page, might have subjected the book
to be committed to the flames without mercy,
and, indeed, without much apparent injustice.</p>

<p>I now resume my subject, after a digression
that may be looked upon as a preface, which the
reader may perhaps think might have been
spared.</p>

<p>In the age we live in, to justify a necessary
impost, by the pretence of paying off the debt,
would be, of all state manœuvres, the most unpardonable.
To lay heavy burdens on the
people now, so as to liberate them in the space
of a century, is, independent of a great many
more improbabilities, to suppose, in the plan of
administration, an immutability which it cannot
give itself, and which does not, nor ever can
exist. To leave the individuals of a nation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
possession of all, that it is not indispensable to
take away from them, in order that, with what
they have left, they may acquire that which it
will be perhaps necessary to deprive them of, is
a principle, the absurdity of which it would be
no easy matter to evince; but, to crush them
under such an additional weight of taxes as
would be necessary to exonerate them forty or
fifty years hence, would be, in my opinion, attempting
a measure, some of the consequences
of which have no doubt escaped the attention of
the proposers.</p>

<p>What may be the immediate effect of a considerable
reimbursement, which even solely depends
on the produce of taxation, and by no
means of a real increase of specie in the nation?
It consists in refunding to the lenders a sum
which must cease to be useful to them, till it is
replaced somewhere else; and obliging them to
vest it, without loss of time, on that portion of the
debt which is not yet acquitted.—But this privileged
portion, which, previous to the reimbursement,
was supposed only worth 80, and produced
four, (it may be observed that, in the numbers,
which I fix upon, I only look for terms to explain
my meaning) will be worth 90, and presently
100, yet will not bring in more than <i>four</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
It may be answered, the stocks rise, public credit
increases.—We are not yet come to this
point; but the fortune of the repaid stockholders,
which does not consist in a nominal capital,
but in the revenue it produces, will therefore,
in fact, suffer a diminution of one whole
fifth. What will then become of that fifth of
the taxed objects consumed by them, and which
they can no longer purchase?—It will, in my
opinion, be necessary either to put a stop to the
manufacturing of that fifth, and throw so many
hands out of employment, or else lower the
prices, yet continue to levy the tax, and then the
manufacturer will complain of the burden; or,
in fine, this fifth, now useless to the nation, must
be exported, and this adds to the first inconvenience
resulting from the tax imposed for the
reimbursement: for, after all, if taxation operates
in the manner it appears at first sight to do, that
is, if it diminishes the means of consumption,
then, by laying 1,000,000 of taxes appropriated
to the liquidation of the debt, you have diminished
your home-consumption, it matters not of what
articles; you have diminished it, and still more so
by the incapacity, to which the creditors paid off
are reduced, of consuming that which they did
consume previous to the reimbursement. Your
exportation, it may be said, is by so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
more increased, and enriched.—Granted;—but
at whose expence? Who is to profit by it? In
what manner are the returns to be made?⸺When
foreign trade augments in proportion to
the increase of the produce and home-consumption,
it is easily conceived, that if the money
imported does not exceed the proportion necessary
to answer that double increase, the progression
being equal every way, each article (money
among the rest) will keep up to its value; but if
the number of representatives is increased without
any addition being made to the objects represented,
is not the price of representation thereby
diminished? Or, in other words, if you add to
the real stock of money in the nation, at the expence
of part of your own consumption, (which
is the object in question) will not the price of the
other parts of that same consumption rise in spite
of you?</p>

<p>Besides, by diminishing, in any quantity
whatever, the general mass of home-consumption,
(and in the present supposition you may
well think that it has decreased, both by the tax
imposed and the reimbursement made) have the
sums appropriated to that part of the consumption,
annihilated by you, been withdrawn from
the circulation? If not, then by adding thereto
the increase of that balance in your favour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
which you pretend to receive from abroad, by
what means can you prevent a general rise in
the prices, in proportion, not only to the quantity
of that fatal money imported, but also to
that cash, which ought to have been buried under
ground, that it might, at least, only prove
useless, after the home-consumption has undergone
the diminution occasioned by the reimbursement
and taxes? This is not all; the unfortunate
creditors who have been paid off, already
reduced from five parts of what they enjoyed,
to four only, will certainly, soon after you
shall have put the said balance into circulation,
become unable, with the <i>four</i> that
remain, to purchase more articles than they
could have procured with <i>three</i>, previous to the
tax and reimbursement.</p>

<p>Will you pretend to say, that this money does
not circulate within the nation? that it becomes
the source of a new trade? and that the
exporters, instead of over-loading <i>England</i> with
that specie, send or carry abroad the value thereof
from <i>Spain</i> into <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and <i>Russia</i>?—that
is to say, after having reduced the home-consumption,
the exporters, who, rightly enough,
are not willing to lose, will contribute to extend
the internal consumption of <i>Spain</i>, <i>France</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
<i>Germany</i> and <i>Russia</i>, and of course <i>the ways and
means</i> of these different nations, as well as the
produce of their taxes, in the same proportion as
those objects have decreased amongst you.—Could
this seriously be your intention?</p>

<p>But if it clearly appear, that the execution of
the refunding plan would prove equally pernicious
in its immediate tendency, both to the
creditors who would be compelled to accept of
it, and those at whose expence it must be effected,
what then might be the case, if the interest of
that debt, which ingrosses so much the public
attention, being paid by <i>all</i>, were, in fact, paid
by <i>no one</i>, but for so long a time as nature,
assisted by all the calculations of individuals,
may require to correct the errors of those upon a larger
scale, <i>made by administration, when administration
is capable of making any</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading9"><i>In what manner the Interest of the National Debt
will be probably paid off.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>It is the most generally received and best
respected opinion, that taxes should in preference
be laid on the articles of luxury. There
is not a man possessed of the least feeling and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
honesty, who does not approve of this maxim,
and whose wish has not often been that the
wealthy only should pay the taxes. Canting
enthusiasts further add, that the expence and
luxury of the rich, prove the ruin of the nation.
Be it so. But when the question is, to define
what is luxury, in order to subject it to a tax,
every individual exclaims, that it begins precisely
with those articles which the mediocrity
of his means, places above his reach. Instead of
laying a tax on beer, would it not be better to
increase that on hackney-coaches? says a porter
who is stopped at a crossing, by one of the above
vehicles; whilst the supposed idler who sits in
the coach, and pays for it, exclaims, at the
sight of a gilt carriage, that crosses and stops his
way: What! 500<i>l.</i> laid out on a single article
of luxury! Would it not be better to tax the
owner by so much, and apply the produce to the
maintenance of fifty poor objects during six
months? But, my dear Sir, the manufacturing
of this very carriage has maintained a far greater
number. If you begin with the man who extracted
from the mine, that gold, which, with indignation,
you see glittering on the wheels; if it is not
beneath you to notice the child employed in
driving away the flies that might have hurt the
gloss of the varnish when first laid on; and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
you end your list only with those who, instead of
horses, dragged the carriage into the coach-house
of that stately man, whose pomp gives you so
much offence; would it have pleased you more
if all those hands had been paid for doing nothing?
The rich man alone, say you, ought to
pay the taxes: but it is impossible that they
should be paid by others, “<i>if it be true, that
every man, destitute of a capital, can pay nothing
but at the expence of the capitalist</i>.”</p>

<p>It would be a difficult matter to trace out,
with exactness, the progress of the taxes; but it
appears to me, that whatever be the mode of
establishing them, there is not a subject who does
not contribute his share sooner or later, unless
nature should annul the burden, even before
the clashing of private interests should have
succeeded in settling the division upon equitable
principles.</p>

<p>The downfall of <i>England</i> was foretold at her
very first loan. This prophecy did not destroy
the means of funding, on a very solid basis, in
the year 1762, that part of the national debt,
till then unfunded. Now I would ask the man,
whom I should know to be most intimately persuaded
of the dreadful effect that must be produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
by a debt of 64,234,595<i>l.</i> incurred from
1754 to 1762, in addition to a still heavier one,
contracted since the time when the total amount
of the landed revenue was rated at 32,000,000,
and the value of the lands only at 320 millions,
that is to say, at about double the value of the
whole national debt as it stands at present: I
would ask that man, I say, whether, between the
years 1763 and 1775, he has been able to discover
in any parts of <i>England</i>, one single symptom
of decay, either in agriculture or commerce, any
diminution of public or private enjoyments, or
less insolence amongst the common people, by
which one may surely judge of the alterations
which may happen in their circumstances. This
general observation may suffice to make us look
on the period of 1775, as presenting a state of
things, which, supposing it had been prolonged,
could not have held out any alarming prospect.
Every one worked or enjoyed, and every body
was paid. All this, methinks, might have continued
on the same footing to the end of the
world, without any alteration on the former or
subsequent fortune of any one, such only excepted,
as industry, activity, imprudence, and
foresight, must occasion in all countries where
justice is blind, and has but one scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>I readily acknowledge, that at that period a
grievous war broke out, which did not conclude
till 60 millions, nominally 100, had been
added to the old debt, or, to come more
directly to the point, till the nation had been
loaded, or, if you please, crushed under the
enormous weight of three additional millions
interest to be paid annually. But in what
manner will those three millions, so heavy,
so dreadful, affect the interested parties? In my
judgement, it will be the same with this additional
burden, as it has been with the six millions
which the said parties were wont to pay
before the last war. It certainly must have been
felt at first by every body, except the trading
part of the nation, whose first operation ever was
to add to the price of the taxed commodities,
both the amount of the tax, and the benefit of
the advance to the consumer. (<span class="smcap">and this
is strictly consonant with Justice.</span>)
Now these consumers are of two sorts, viz. the
proprietor of lands, and the proprietor of money:
the latter must also be considered under
a two-fold point of view, as a capitalist for
himself, or as a dependant who receives the
money from either of the two proprietors. The
proprietor of money, from the nature of this
instrument of trade, is a being merely passive;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
twenty shillings, which he is paid for interest,
can <i>currently</i> enable him to purchase such articles
only as <i>currently</i> sell for 20 shillings. If
the taxes had increased, by one tenth, the price
of all the commodities which he used to consume
before the war of 1755, it is clear, therefore,
that in 1763 he had lost one tenth
of all his <i>possible</i> enjoyments: I say possible;
for the monied man, I speak in general, saves
enough, annually, to strike an advantageous
balance against the inconveniences <i>inseparable</i>
from his capital; I mean that progressive and
unavoidable depreciation of money, so long as
there will be mines opened, and taxes to discharge.
But he can effect it with the greater
ease, as his stock often returns 5 <i>per cent.</i>
whilst the capital of the landed proprietor brings
him in hardly four, and often less.</p>

<p>The <i>dependent</i> proprietor of money had also
his resource; he, by degrees, obtained an increase
of salary; (<span class="smcap">and this is strictly consonant
with justice</span>.)</p>

<p>Neither was the landed proprietor without
his resource: he gradually raised the price of his
goods, and would have increased it to the level
of the whole amount of the produce of industry;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
(<span class="smcap">and this would have been strictly
consonant with justice</span>.) But nature very often
anticipates the execution of that very equitable
measure, by another operation which is as infallibly
the consequence of peace, as taxes
are the effect of war, ever since the abolishing
of personal service. The 10, 15, 20 millions,
which government had borrowed during the war,
were nothing more than a part of the capitals
which in happier times might have been laid
out in the improvement of cultivation and industry.
Peace brought them back to their destination;
an increase in the quantity of the
produce of lands was the consequence; and
an equal increase in the demands of the productions
of industry, occasioned by the former,
kept up the price of every thing, <i>by facilitating
to the one, the means of purchasing what the other
wanted to dispose of</i>, and by presenting an increase
of resources to that increase of population,
which as certainly results from peace and
plenty, as mortality does from war and scarcity.</p>

<p>I now return to the three millions interest
brought upon this nation by the last war; and I
demand, what reason can prevent similar effects
resulting from similar causes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Yet, in order to obtain a complete idea of
the whole burden of this <i>formidable</i> debt, we
must suppose that the full amount of it was contracted
during the last war; and then we shall
see how many millions of guineas it would
really cost <i>England</i> to pay off for ever the interest
of all her successes and miscarriages from
the beginning of this century, if the 9 millions
of taxes should be now established in order
to supply the interest of the debt of 238
millions.</p>

<p>It will appear hereafter, that 9 millions of
taxes laid on the articles of consumption, would
increase, by about 14 millions, the price or nominal
value of the whole produce of industry,
rated upon supposition at 56 millions. Now it
seems to me equally unjust and impossible, that
the total amount of the produce of agriculture
should not thereby be increased in the like proportion:
I beg to be allowed this supposition,
until I assign my reasons for it, and bring proofs
sufficiently positive to ascertain the fact.</p>

<p>Be it supposed, then, that the collective revenue
of land and industry do amount to 112
millions, independent of the taxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>Let us equally suppose that 40 millions sterling,
in cash and paper currency, would be necessary
and sufficient for the circulation of the
said 112 millions.</p>

<p>Fourteen millions, in taxes, and in the advanced
prices which must follow, are one
eighth of 112 millions revenue, which, by the
necessary rise in the price of every thing, is carried
to 126 millions. Now, 5 millions in cash
and paper currency, are likewise one eighth part
of the supposed 40 millions necessary for home
circulation.—It would then cost <i>England</i> only
5 millions in cash and paper, once found, to secure
for ever, and in the most permanent manner,
the interest of a debt of 238 millions, the very
idea of which shook the firm nerves of the
<i>Walpoles</i>, the <i>Humes</i>, and of the many experienced
men, on whose authority it was no
weakness to tremble, before investigating a
matter, which nobody, in my judgement, had
hitherto attempted to examine.</p>

<p>All the operations of Nature are slow, gradual,
imperceptible; and how is it possible to
trace her out in her progress, when, in the measures
which lead her to the general good, she
has recourse only to that multitude of private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
interests which seemingly tend to destroy it?
Yet, in order that we may form some idea of her
operations in the point in question, let us execute,
in an instant, that which she would effect
in half a century, if it were possible within that
space of time to incur a debt of 420 millions,
without any augmentation or decrease taking
place in the landed revenue.</p>

<h3><i>First Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>Let us suppose, that, instead of appropriating
the capitals that have disappeared, either to undertakings
relative to agriculture and industry,
(which would have trebled the real revenue,) or to
those wars, either successful or grievous, that have
left behind them only a frivolous or bitter recollection—let
us suppose, I say, that Government
should have, till this day, thought of nothing
but making public establishments, and that every
contributor to the public expence, being permitted
at last to live up to the full rate of
his means, should find the fruit of his former
privations, in a multitude of monuments, such
as the most luxuriant fancy can conceive,
from the wisest disposal of the capitals, and of
the time necessary to incur a national debt,
the interest of which, added to the increase resulting
from the taxes, should amount to 32<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
millions, upon an aggregate revenue of 64 millions,
in which agriculture and industry should
have an equal share. Such, nearly, was the
state of the nation, under <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>,
as we have already observed.</p>

<p>The tax laid on the produce of industry
would double the 32 millions: this is just; nor
can it be doubted; for there is not a manufacturer,
whose goods or produce have just been
taxed, but will acknowledge this truth. Besides,
the <i>British</i> Parliament avows it. What remains
now, is to convince the landed proprietors, that
by doubling also their 32 millions revenue, they
injure no one whatever. It is needless to prove,
that if they act otherwise, if they be only
passive when the manufacturers are so justly
active, they must be reduced to plough those
lands that acknowledge them for their lords.</p>

<p>Previous to the tax, the 32 millions landed
revenue, used to cost, annually, to the landlord
and farmer, 9 or 10 millions, paid to the cultivators,
and laid out in other expences. Such
is the rate; nearly one third of the revenue,
(See <i>A. Young</i>’s Political Arithmetic.) Before
the tax, industry must have laid out amongst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the handicraftsmen, nine or ten of her 32 millions.</p>

<p>By doubling, therefore, the price of labour
in agriculture and industry, the labouring people
of both, will, under the numbers 18 or 20, have
what they had before under those of 9 or 10;
and these two great engines of national wealth
will no ways be clogged.</p>

<p>As for the two <i>capitalists</i> in land and industry,
it is clear that each of them will have exactly
the faculty of preparing, buying, selling, consuming,
and saving, under the denomination of
30, 40, 60, &amp;c. all that they could prepare,
buy, sell, consume, and save, under that of 15,
20, 30, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before we attend to the lender, let us advert
to the State; and let it be observed, that <i>in the
case where 20 millions of cash and paper currency
would have sufficed for the circulation and national
transactions of all kinds, at a time when both
revenues amounted to 64 millions, it is enough to
find out 20 millions more, whenever, by the effect
of taxation, those said revenues are raised from
64 to 128 millions; and from the instant that
those 20 millions in cash and paper currency are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
obtained, you may flatter yourselves to have established,
<span class="upright">funded</span> most firmly and for ever, the interest
of a national debt of 420 millions, the interest
of which, would at 5 per cent. amount to 21 millions</i>.</p>

<p>It is not yet time to examine what influence
so considerable a rise, in the price of every thing,
might have upon the foreign trade; but let us
turn our thoughts to the interest of the stockholder,
who has so generously lent his money.
It will be said, that he is evidently injured:
<i>the interest due to him on account of his loan,
was equal to two-thirds of the landed revenue:
the land is mortgaged to the creditors of the state:
two-thirds of the neat revenue belong therefore in
fact to the lender. A few years more, employed
in erecting useful buildings, bridges, causeways,
&amp;c. the whole landed revenue must have been
absorbed, and the lender have entered into possession.</i></p>

<p>Such is nearly the result of Mr. <i>Hume</i>’s reasoning
on this pretended <i>mania</i> of supplying the
wants of the State, by mortgaging its revenue.
Let me be permitted to urge a few words in
answer, on behalf of the landed proprietor.</p>

<p>Whatever use the sums borrowed are put to
by government, in this respect the nation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the lender stand nearly in the same predicament
as two individuals who should have set up an
undertaking at a joint expence: when it is
completed, each of them first takes back his
capital, before they share the profits. In point
of national enterprises, is war the object? The
profit is existence and glory, if the war has
proved successful. Are public establishments
in prospect? Then the lender shares in their
utility and comfort. Has the employing of the
capital been productive neither of glory, nor
public establishments? In a word, is the State
reduced to its primary and bare existence? The
capital lent will not, at least, be lost to the
lender, <i>if administration think fit to observe how
little it costs to be just</i>; and the lender, on his
part, will reflect, that he should not have been a
greater gainer, had he buried his treasure during
the time of national distress and that, had he
lent it to individuals, he might have lost it entirely.</p>

<p>What I have just said, will, I think, suffice
to refute the extravagant pretensions which
Mr. <i>Hume</i> is pleased to suppose in the lender.
What I shall add, will also be sufficient, I hope,
to quiet the scrupulous minds of those who
might entertain some doubts on the injustice of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
despoiling the landed proprietor; I mean, the
injustice of any kind of spoliation, but that
which may be the consequence of his own extravagance.</p>

<p>That man who gives up his land for the annual
quit-rent of a quarter of wheat, and two
shillings when the wheat was at four shillings only,
supposed he had entitled himself and his heirs to
an income of a quarter and a half of wheat; yet
his representatives enjoy, at this day, only one
quarter, and the 18th or 20th part of another.—Will
these insist, that the meaning of the landlord
having been to secure, and that of the
tenant to grant, such a portion of the landed
revenue, as might be at all times equal to a quarter
and a half of wheat, it is unjust to act in
direct opposition to the intention of the contracting
parties? This objection would appear very
forcible, and yet would go no further than to
prove, that, when a proprietor gives up his land
for an annual consideration, he ought to stipulate
that it should be paid in kind, if he means to
keep up to the same income; if not, the landlord
must be referred to the terms of his contract.</p>

<p>The state-creditor stands in a far more
disagreeable predicament; he cannot even suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
on his part, an intention hostile to
the general good. Whoever lends to the
State, knows that the latter cannot pay the interest
it submits to, but by taxes, which, in the
long-run, affect every thing alike; and that one
must cease to be a consumer, if he would forbear
coming in for his share. Now, whilst the exigency
of the State requires fresh loans, and
course additional taxes, whoever advances of
the stock, the interest of which is paid by
means of those very taxes, cannot entertain any
hopes of avoiding their effect, unless it be for
a short period, which depends entirely on
the adopted scheme of finance. Some of
these schemes extend, others shorten the round
such taxes must go through, before the burden
falls equally on every shoulder, <i>and becomes
null by its universality</i>. I say <i>null</i>, all injustice
set aside, which is inseparable from some sorts
of taxes, of which I shall speak hereafter;
but, I add, <i>strictly null</i>, even in regard to the
lender, although the price of every article be
raised, whilst his revenue alone continues on the
same standard. And I ground my opinion on
the following reason, which appears to me
unanswerable: The difference between the interest
of money, and that of landed property,
is always a sufficient indemnity to the monied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
man for the rise, occasioned by the taxes, on the
prices of the produce of land and industry; but
<i>nothing can compensate the landed proprietor
for that pretended increase of wealth called Money,
or that supposed poverty known by the name
of Taxes, but a proportionable increase in the price
of his goods</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. A word more on the lender.
One may take the part of that important individual,
who accumulates those savings by which
the State is to profit. It is allowed, I say, to
support such a man even against the State, when
the State attempts to reduce him by an useless
reimbursement, by an <i>unnatural</i> operation; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
he should be assigned his real rank in the
State, that he may not complain of the <i>natural</i>
reductions. In this case, I think, we should be
more just, more humane, and more equitable, than
Mr. <i>Hume</i>, when, in the continuation of the
scheme of national loans, he offers to the posterity
of the present owners of landed estates, no
other prospect than that of serving, as coachmen,
the descendents of their footmen, and no
other means of averting the prophecy—but <i>a
bankruptcy</i>. (<i>Vide</i> <i>Hume’s Public Credit</i>, Essay
IX.)</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading10"><i>Reflections on the two foregoing Articles.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>If it were very true, though upon the first
blush rather strange, that after an operation
so simple as that of increasing the price of the
whole mass of commodities, or rather suffering
it <i>naturally to increase</i>, in proportion as the taxes
and the effects produced by them enhance the
price of all the products of industry, which are
to bear those taxes—were it true, I say, that after
so plain, so simple an operation, it would suffice,
in order to secure for ever, in the most efficacious
manner, the payment of the interest on any given
national debt whatever, to find, <i>once for all</i>, in cash
and paper, a sum which would exactly be, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
mass of the specie and paper already in circulation,
as the interest of the debt, and the reactions
of which I shall speak in the sequel, are to the
mass of the two revenues—were it equally
true, that those who are to be paid that interest,
should, <i>after these two previous data</i>, have nothing
in the world to dread but the reimbursement
of a principal, the interest of which should
appear so oddly secured, it would then be impossible
not to confess, that <i>England</i> has hitherto
been a prey to great uneasiness, with very
little foundation.</p>

<p>It would then be necessary to conclude, that
all other nations were greatly in the wrong to
think that <i>England</i> had any reason to be
alarmed.</p>

<p>It must, in this case also, be acknowledged,
that <i>France</i>, in 1720, very unreasonably cut
asunder the <i>Gordian</i> knot of her difficulties, by
declaring in substance that she owed no longer
15 millions <i>Tournois</i> of the debts which she
had contracted; since, without so barbarously
cutting the knot, and thereby effecting the
ruin of thousands of wretched beings, she would
have secured their fortune by imposing without
mercy, or rather with judgement, a tax of 75<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
millions on all the produce of industry, which
this tax would not have raised by one twentieth
part; whilst an <i>Arrêt</i> from the council, permitting
<i>then</i> the exportation of grain, which
was not allowed till 50 years after, would have
proved more than sufficient to enhance, as it
must have done, the price of commodities, in
order to make amends to the landed proprietors
for the increase which they would have found
in the products of industry.</p>

<p>Above all, it would be necessary to admit,
that no minister, in any country, could, for the
future, without a horrid perverseness, without
a want of judgement bordering upon insanity,
propose, neither all together nor separately, expedients
as shameful as they would prove useless;
and that no individual could hereafter
dread such measures, without being guilty of
folly. What a security, then, for the Subject!
what an advantage to the State! what a <i>facility</i>
for Administration!</p>

<p>Under this point of view, the idea I start deserves
to be examined; but I once more entreat
the reader not to pronounce finally upon it,
until it has undergone the full exposition which
I propose to give it. Nor shall I think I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
have written in vain, if I succeed only in making
it appear so feasible, as to induce some abler
hand more deeply to investigate it. Where is
the man who would not wish to find it true?
where is the man who could have an interest in
finding it otherwise? I confess, perhaps to my
shame, that it has engrossed my attention for a
long series of years; I apply it to every thing,
I square it with every thing; and the more I
consider it under all the suppositions which my
fancy suggests, the more I compare these suppositions
with all the facts which it is possible to
ascertain, and which seem to bear any relation to
the subject, the more am I convinced, not only
that the matter stands thus, but even that it is
impossible it should be otherwise.</p>

<p>In fact, if I return to <i>Great-Britain</i>⸺</p>

<p>It would be absurd to suppose, that the taxes
necessary to discharge the debt incurred during
the late war, exceed the twentieth part of the
value of the products both of foreign and national
industry, consumed within the country.
In this case, is it not impossible that the additional
tax of a twentieth, in whatever manner it
may be assessed on the mass of those products,
should not enhance, by a twentieth, the value<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of this very mass? Let us call it a fifteenth; all
kind of reaction included.</p>

<p>Is it not impossible that this additional fifteenth
on the price of the products of industry, be not
followed, sooner or later, by an equal augmentation
on the productions of the earth, unless
the proprietors of land should submit to diminish,
by one fifteenth, their own consumption,—the
home consumption (<i>the only one that
secures the prosperity of the State</i>) and diminish
it, in order to increase, by so much, the exportation,
according to the ideas commonly adopted
which would be as contrary to the facts that I
shall adduce hereafter, as it would prove hostile
to the interest of the State, to the interest of the
proprietors, and would operate in direct opposition
to the spirit of the tax, <i>which is certainly
to produce its own amount, without taking the
trouble, every year, of going in search of it to
<span class="upright">Lisbon</span></i>.</p>

<p>Is it not impossible that the augmentation of
one fifteenth, upon the price of every produce
in circulation, should require any thing above
an additional fifteenth, in the sums which had
been hitherto sufficient for <i>brokerage</i>, and the
transports of all kinds of property?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Is it not impossible that this fifteenth, both
in new specie and paper currency, once obtained,
the interest of the latter part of the debt
should not be very firmly established, <i>funded</i>,
without any one being the worse for it, <i>if the price
of labour increases like that of its produce</i>?</p>

<p>Such, I repeat it, such will be, in the last analysis,
the result of the underworkings of nature;
of nature, ever more slow, but ever more skilful
in repairing evil than men are in creating
it; of nature, who, as good at all times as
the bread which she breaks to her children,
fills up without intermission, incessantly levels,
behind them, and unknown to them, whilst
they are amusing themselves or playing tricks
upon each other, all those little furrows which
they imagine will be left to the care of their
posterity.</p>

<p>Some one, no doubt, will exclaim against this
additional fifteenth upon the prices of every commodity;
an augmentation which I have represented
as the only remaining trace of a war,
which, for five years, attracted in both hemispheres,
the eyes of all whose brains were not
heated by it. I shall grant therefore that it
was necessary to add thereto,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>First, the trifling difference which must result
from the impossibility of a thorough good
understanding between the interested parties,
together with the intention, not very liberal,
but natural enough to each of them, of gaining
more than they can lose.</p>

<p>Secondly, the difference, perhaps more sensible,
which must follow the method so much
boasted, of taxing in preference, those objects
which are consumed by the rich; as if it were
possible to apply to any object, an extraordinary
portion of a given revenue, without taking off
that very portion from some other article, the
consumption of <i>which is equally necessary to the
subsistence of artizans of another kind</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and in fine, the far more considerable
difference which must be produced, <i>especially in
England</i>, by another kind of taxation, of which
I shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>Nothing contributes so much to render a
question undeterminable, as to perplex it with
a multitude of accessaries, each of which would
require a separate dissertation; consequently,
nothing can render the solution easier than to
reduce it to the smallest compass. Some
other person will, no doubt, do much better,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
what I can do only according to the
extent of my abilities; nor did ever an author
peruse his own work with more pleasure
than I shall read the production of any one who
shall throw the light of evidence where I
can only form surmises. But if it be true,
that after a short space of time, without any
other assistance than the natural clashing of
one interest with another, taxes, <i>judiciously laid</i>,
are hurtful neither to individuals nor to the
State,—would it not be better to labour with
care to <i>lay them judiciously</i>, than to think
of a reimbursement, the only effect of which
will be to diminish, for a short time, amongst
some individuals, the power of paying those
very taxes?</p>

<p>I beg permission to add a word more on this
fatal reimbursement.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading11"><i>A Thought substituted to that of a Reimbursement.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>To write in <i>England</i>, nay, to write with obstinacy
against the plan of a reimbursement, the
necessity of which is acknowledged by the whole
nation, who expect wonders from its execution;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
to write for the purpose of persuading that such
a step would equally militate against the interest
of the State, and that of the subject; and especially
to hazard such visionary ideas at the moment
when <i>France</i>, so clear-sighted on her own
interests, is herself busy in effecting a like
reimbursement ... must surely be the attempt of a
man hired by the <i>French</i>, to excite, if possible,
some ferment in those heads which are all wound
up to calculation; and to raise, during the little
time the calculations will require, some plausible
doubts, in order at least to delay the effect,
of so salutary, so essential an operation; for,
<i>France</i> is so interested in the ruin of <i>England</i>,
that she ought to spare no means to stop her,
were it but for an instant, at that point which it
has not been possible to prevent her from attaining.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to write in <i>French</i>, and
endeavour to introduce into <i>France</i>, a pamphlet
in which the author does not profess himself
an admirer of a reimbursement, the
possibility of which, now clearly demonstrated,
has excited there a general enthusiasm, a kind of
rapture the more excusable, as the most evident
disorder in all parts of the finances, during the
space of 80 years, did not permit even the humane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
and sensible mind to form a single wish for that
very measure of which the execution is so certain,
and the advantages pretended to be so positive....
It is suing with impudence for the good graces
of a nation, to which I have, as it were, been
turned over by the cession made to it of the
country where my fortune lies: it is ridiculously
flattering myself that I shall justify by a
<i>trait</i> of unbridled licence, the title of <i>Englishman</i>,
conferred on me by the treaty of peace.</p>

<p>It is certain, that more than once a man has
been most secretly accused, tried with the greatest
expedition, condemned without being heard,
and punished with merciless severity, in consequence
of charges much less specious than the
above; for I confess that there is a faint glimmer
of plausibility in the heads of accusation
which I have brought. But, in the end, justice
must be done; and, thank heaven, my present
trial is on the very first instance, brought to its
last stage; the public shall be my judge; they
shall be put in possession of all the documents relating
to the trial; and I presume to hope, that
no one of those who shall be able to bear the perusal
of them, will suspect my sincerity when I
protest, that, without any other motive but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
which has at all times invariably guided me
through life, I would burn this paper, if I
could find therein a single word that might
be hurtful to <i>France</i>—I would burn it, were I
to find therein a single word that might be
hurtful to <i>England</i>—I would burn it, were I
to find therein a single word that might give
offence to any individual of either of the two
kingdoms.—But I freely own, that my ambition
would be far from receiving its full gratification,
were this work to prove useful only to those two
parts of the world, however brilliant the part
they act therein.—<span class="allsmcap">URBI ET ORBI.</span>—<i>Shakespear</i>
says that the Warrior seeks “the bubble <i>glory</i>
in the cannon’s mouth:” a man who presumes
to think, looks for it in the bottom of
his inkstand: their hope is not always crowned
with success; nay, very often, the one meets
only death, and the other contempt. Yet there
are some lucky chances: sometimes the former
saves his country, the latter is sometimes serviceable
to all mankind.</p>

<p>Be it as it may, I intreat the reader to observe,
that the principles I lay down do not tend,
by any means, to lessen the public credit, to
spread any doubt on the faculties which <i>France</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and <i>England</i> have of effecting the reimbursement
which both these nations have in contemplation;
I maintain, on the contrary, with the simplicity
of a <i>child</i>, that it is a <i>childish play</i>, for the one as
well as for the other. I say, that the one who
appears the most distressed of the two, and is the
most taken up with her pretended distress, has only
to take from the <i>pocket</i> of one, what he will be
very <i>averse to give</i>, and put it into the <i>hands</i> of another,
who will be equally <i>averse to receive</i>. I
say, with respect to the nation, which <i>now</i> acts the
most brilliant part, that all she has to do, is to
give, to those who do not ask for it, a sum of
money which she receives, and has no occasion
for; <i>to give it</i>, I say, for fear of being solicited,
importuned, and teazed, to make a
bad use of it, or else be obliged to hoard it
up, to the very great detriment of circulation.
I shall add now, that a business, which to me,
does not appear a <i>childish</i> one, but really that of a
man, would be to examine, whether the 40 or 50
millions of livres annuity, which are about to
expire by degrees in <i>France</i>, and the million, or
million and half sterling of taxes to be levied in
<i>England</i>, over and above the sum necessary to
pay the interest of the national debt, and other
state expenditures, will be better employed in
the diminution of some private revenue than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the increase of the general wealth in both States;
that is to say, whether it is most advantageous to
pay off the creditors, who, by such a reimbursement,
will be compelled to place at 4 and at 3,
what brought them in 5 and 4 <i>per cent.</i> than to
lay out the money, for the purpose of increasing,
perhaps by one fourth, the products of agriculture
and industry, by a faithful and judicious
repartition of those sums upon the cultivation of
some millions of acres, which now yield nothing
but brambles, or yield only the half of what
they ought to produce.—How many of this
description are to be found both in <i>England</i>
and <i>France</i>!⸺This is not all: how many
kinds of taxes, the effects of which have not
been sufficiently searched into! How many
more, whose pernicious consequences are fully
known! How many more, the levying of
which can be justified only by reason of
their produce being wanted, or by <i>the supposed</i>
impossibility of a commutation!—Ought the
State to reimburse, before those have been scrutinized,
these repealed, and all commuted
which shall appear evidently to militate against
sound principles?</p>

<p>The great art does not consist in finding, at
pleasure, one million sterling more in <i>France</i> as
well as in <i>England</i>, or <i>vice versâ</i>. Heavens!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
what kind of minister would that man be, whose
genius could not discover, in either kingdom,
in the multitude of objects truly susceptible of
taxation, a number of articles capable of furnishing
that million annually, without injuring the
general consumption, beyond the first year at
the worst? The only difference which, in this
respect, I might point out between the two nations,
is, that in <i>France</i> the impost would be
registered, and paid after the usual remonstrances;
and that in <i>England</i>, were the tax to have been
devised, even by Supreme Wisdom, on the
actual system, all those who might think themselves
directly or indirectly interested in the
operation of the tax, would not fail to clamour
as loud as possible, and not without reason; for,
after all, if the objects taxed, are equitably taxed,
and in a due proportion with all the rest, why, out
of 160 objects and upwards, already charged with
equity, should <i>ten</i> be picked out to be overloaded
with a new burden?—Has at least a rotation
been established for the future?—On what
principles? Or does it evidently appear that there
can be no fixed one adopted on so important a
matter?—If a tax is offered to be laid on such
articles as have paid none hitherto, then <i>Opposition</i>
stands on firmer ground; for, are not those
objects, by their nature, evidently as sacred as
the ark of the Lord? Did ever the least scrupulous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the boldest Minister of the finances, dare,
to this day, to lay his hand upon it?—Would
he have respected it, if he had not trembled for his
head; that is, in plain <i>English</i>, for his place?
For, thank Heaven, there is no necessity, now,
for the <i>English</i> to be more hot-headed than any
other nation in <i>Europe</i>. It is generally acknowledged
among themselves, with true <i>English
sang-froid</i>, that, on the part of those champions of
patriotism, who, according to the interest of
the day, charge each other by turns with selling
the people, and betraying the <i><span class="smcap">sacred</span> constitution</i>,
all terminates now in the most exact change of
admirable sarcasms, and exquisite railleries. The
pleasure of being a Minister because <i>the minister
alone can do what is good</i>, and the concern at
not being a Minister, <i>because the minister alone
can do what is good</i>, are now productive of
nothing more in <i>England</i>; and the People, as
well as the King, are not worse served for it, nor
are they worse informed: witness the speeches
on both sides.</p>

<p>Amongst the questions which I have mentioned,
and many others always appropriated to
the subject, there are some sufficiently weighty
to puzzle, in <i>England</i> as well as in <i>France</i>, the
respondent who should be obliged, before a tax
is laid, to answer them in a <i>satisfactory</i> manner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Luckily, as I have already mentioned, in <i>France</i>,
thanks to the monarchical constitution, the King
<i>commands</i>, the Parliament remonstrates, registers,
and the People pay: and, as is known
to all the world, thanks to the free constitution
of <i>England</i>, there the King <i>demands</i>, the parliament
debates, grants, and the People pay.
With that facility which exists every where, of
doing what is not palpably absurd, I think it
might be possible now, without bringing credit
or authority in question, to renounce the little
vanity of devising a productive tax; and that a
man of common abilities ought to confine himself
to the establishing or maintaining order and
clearness in the accounts, to the diminution of
expences in collecting the revenues, and to
fidelity in the use of them.—But the true, the
unacquired glory to be obtained by a financier,
would be, I think, to hit upon a simple scheme,
the application of which might be obvious in
all cases, a scheme productive of no fruitless
evil, permitting all possible good, and which
might, by degrees, be substituted to those
vague taxations, to those <i>taxations</i> founded on
false principles, to those wild notions, which, by
adding <i>five</i> to an article not worth <i>three</i>, raise
nevertheless that object to <i>eight</i>, and leave the
trader at liberty to sell that for <i>fifteen</i>, which he
sold formerly at <i>four</i>. It is true that, on the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
exigency of the State, they pretend to remedy the
abuse by an additional tax called <i>licence</i>, or by
any other name which answers the same purpose,
and compels the peculator to refund part of his
extortion. But what does this licence come to,
after all?—<i>To sell to a man the right of ransoming
more severely the public, after having previously
furnished him with the means and pretence
for doing it.</i></p>

<p>No one doubts, in <i>England</i>, but that the
system of <i>French</i> taxation is a very bad one;
nothing so self-evident as the reasons adduced in
proof; every thinking man in <i>France</i> approves
of those reasons:—but does it clearly appear, that
in <i>England</i> some parts of that system are not
adopted?—Is it not true, on the contrary, that
it has prevailed, for a long time, in one point
truly essential, in regard to which they have but
diminished its inconveniencies, without thinking
perhaps of the injustice, which is as inseparable
from it, as it is from those wherein it appears
more evidently?—The advantage of taxing the
consumption is generally acknowledged; it is as
generally believed that the way of bringing this
system to perfection is by taxing, above all, <i>the consumption
of the rich</i>:—yet, were it to happen that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the poor should be more injured, and that for a
longer time, by a natural effect of the very
operation devised for their release, than he
could be aggrieved if nothing should escape the
tax....</p>

<p>I shall venture to throw out some thoughts on
these different objects, after I have examined
whether the necessity of a balance of trade, constantly
favourable, be not as doubtful as that of
a reimbursement, and a bankruptcy; and whether
that balance is really such as many people
imagine it.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading12"><i>General Balance of Trade in <span class="upright">England</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>When the proprietor of a considerable sum
in the <i>English</i> funds examines Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>’s
truly valuable work, <i>State of the Trade
of Great-Britain</i>; he thanks his stars, and says,
“I have nothing to fear whilst the balance of
trade continues in favour of this kingdom;
but the moment it shall turn against her, recourse
must inevitably be had to the expedient
so long postponed: the application of the <i>sponge</i>
is inevitable.”—</p>

<p>I have perhaps already said enough to animate
the greater part of those, who are concerned in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the public funds of every enlightened nation,
against every other fear but that of a reimbursement;
but, as it may be believed, with regard to
the public funds in <i>England</i>, that I have reasoned
on the supposition, generally admitted, of that
balance in their favour, of which the <i>English</i> are
so jealous, I would wish doubly to strengthen the
mind of the parties concerned, by proving to them
that their fortune rests on a basis much more solid
than that of a pretended <i>favour</i>, which the private
interest of every merchant, vigilantly repels,
whilst the fancy of the body at large happily
confines them to believe in the idol, and to invoke
it.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the details contained in Sir
<i>Charles Whitworth</i>’s work, for the advantage of
applying to real facts, many reflexions which I
had digested before I had read that work; but I
was, till then, reasoning on <i>hypotheses</i>; I now
reason on what so nearly approaches reality, that
it is necessary to controvert my arguments, instead
of consigning their foundation to the system
of chimeras.</p>

<p>By means of that valuable work, I see, from
the year 1700 to 1775, and that in the greatest
detail, strengthened by all the proofs that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
nature of the subject can admit of, a constant
superiority of exports, which, in the space of
75 years, amounts to the enormous sum of
267,774,769<i>l.</i> (I have overlooked the fractions
of each article.) This is, in the total amount,
much more than one half of the gold and silver
imported into <i>Europe</i> from <i>America</i>, during the
same lapse of time; but, of this period of 75
years, 30 must be attended to, wherein the
superiority of <i>English</i> exports comes up very
nearly to five-sixths of the general importation
of those two precious metals, <i>which were to make
good so many other balances</i>. We should also observe,
amongst those years, a most flourishing
one, wherein that <i>English favour</i> absorbs, as it
were, all the silver imported into <i>Europe</i>; and
five other years still more wonderful, where it
surpasses that general importation by 10, 12,
and even 1,300,000<i>l.</i>; for, in 1750 the general
exportation of <i>English</i> goods exceeded the
importation of foreign produce, by 7,359,964<i>l.</i>
and yet all that product of the <i>mines</i>, belonging
to <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, is estimated only at
6,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>I shall suppose, for a moment, that, during
the space of time I have just mentioned, the balance
of trade did, in reality, produce to <i>England</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
an importation of money, to the amount of
267,774,769<i>l.</i> (for the reports of the Custom-House,
as stated by Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>,
brought in as a proof of that pretended, uninterrupted
balance, in <i>favour</i> of the nation,
mean what I have said, or mean nothing at
all, in regard to this matter; they do not prove
one penny if they do not prove the whole sum).
It is true that, according to the same reports,
we must deduct for the money exported from
<i>England</i>, during the course of those 75 years,
about 105 millions, by which the nation at least
got rid of a surplus which would have strangely
disparaged the price of that which was preserved
in the country: but is it very certain that the
162,774,969<i>l.</i> the precious <i>nett</i> of the pretended
balance, was actually preserved? This appears
to me impossible, for the following reasons, which
may perhaps furnish us with the means of knowing,
precisely enough, in what the true balance
consists.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this century, the real
and nominal value of the revenue in the other
parts of <i>Europe</i>, has doubled, as well as in <i>England</i>.
Now this augmentation, in the products and
prices, has required, every where, a proportionable
increase of the means of circulation; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i> are nearly the only two
sources from whence that increase of means
could be procured.</p>

<p>In the supposition that the revenue of <i>England</i>
constitutes one tenth of that of <i>Europe</i> (it is a
great deal), the other nations composing that part
of the world were of course obliged to endeavour
to secure the nine tenths of the money necessary for
their own circulation; and their success in this is
the less questionable, as, in case any one of them
should be short of money for the circulation
of its property, the <i>English</i> themselves would
eagerly supply that part of the precious balance,
which it might want, because, in this case, the
importation of money into such country would
prove more profitable than an importation of
fresh goods, whilst the old ones, carried there
already, waited for money to circulate them.
Hence it may be concluded, that the <i>English</i>
never had, or at least have not preserved, more
than their tenth, twelfth, or rather, more than
their natural portion in that absolute mass of
gold and silver necessary to the circulation.</p>

<p>I shall now say, that it is not even probable
that they have preserved that <i>quota</i>,
necessary every where else for the circulation of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
revenue similar to theirs, because <i>England</i> is, of
all known nations, the one where the circulation
of property of all kinds, requires a less quantity
of real cash: the merciless severity of the laws
against debtors, the general credit which it encourages,
the use and indubitable value of paper
currency, which are derived equally from both,
are three objects which, in this respect, set <i>England</i>
far above <i>par</i>, in comparison with all the
other nations who have neglected to secure to
themselves the same advantages.</p>

<p>Might we not further say, that <i>England</i> evidently
has not thought proper to get that <i>quota</i>,
which she might have claimed, since one third,
and perhaps half of her circulation, is effected by
paper-money with more dispatch, with more
facility, and with as much solidity as if it were
effected by cash?</p>

<p>It will be asked, perhaps, if I pretend to infer
at last, that the exportation has not been so
considerable as it ought to be supposed from the
statements of Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>? I shall
answer to this, as to many other queries; it may
now be seen that a few millions more or less, are
a matter of perfect indifference, in regard to my
main object. The exportation from <i>England</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
clearly prodigious; its immensity is proved by
that of the tonnage of the shipping employed for
her trade, 775,624 tons in the years 1771, 1772,
and 1773, (see <i>Chalmers</i>’s <i>Estimate</i>); this point
is established beyond all equivocation. What I
refuse therefore to the imagination of the trader,
is solely what appears to me chimerical and useless
in that favourable balance of money; and
this <i>I refuse</i>, because I cannot possibly but acknowledge,
that every trader has too much
good sense to act against the general interest of
trade, when such operation must, at the same time,
prove contrary to his own interest. Nay, is
much more than plain instinct wanted, not to
import money which yields a very trifling benefit
when there is no demand for it, whilst one
may take up foreign goods, on which there is a
certain gain of 10 or 12 <i>per cent.</i> because they
are eagerly sought after? and when, besides, the
nation, on a certainty, will not finally pay for
them but with national goods, since she has no
mines of her own? I must observe, indeed,
that this very trader, guilty of such an act of
<i>impatriotism</i>, of this national crime of importing
merchandize instead of gold and silver, cries up,
as loud as any other, <i>the necessity of striking a
favourable balance</i>; but private wisdom gets the
better of public folly; every one imports such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
goods as he is in hopes to sell to advantage, and
leaves to his neighbour the care of importing
that <i>favour</i> on which no profit can be got.</p>

<p>What is then the quantity of bullion really
imported every year into <i>England</i>?</p>

<p>It is incontestably, in the first place, so much
of it as is necessary to answer the progressive increase
of the prices and products, both of
the land and industry; the bank-notes cannot
suffice to that augmentation, but in their
ordinary proportion to the real specie in circulation;
all supplement of bank-notes, which
in the needful hour exceeds that proportion,
must soon be replaced by real specie; on this
exactness stand the credit of the Bank, and the
vast advantage accruing therefrom to the public,
and to the State; but from thence also results
a greater inutility of accumulating money before
it is wanted.</p>

<p>It is, in the second place, all the bullion necessary
for the labouring gold and silver-smiths,
from the first gold-smith in <i>London</i> to the last
plated-button maker at <i>Birmingham</i>.</p>

<p>It is, thirdly, all that importation which is
required to make good the <i>deficit</i> occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
by petty stock-jobbing, and the melting down of
guineas, which no workman will ever scruple,
when there will be a few more pence to be got
that way, than by the purchase of bullion, or as
often as, having no bullion at hand, he shall find
himself in the immediate necessity of working.</p>

<p>It is, fourthly, all that which is wanted to
replace the few guineas carried away annually
from <i>England</i> by travellers, smugglers, or by
means of some inferior transactions in trade, and
which cannot always be exactly balanced by the
contraband trade carried on elsewhere by the
nation.</p>

<p>Ever since the <i>English</i> have acquired the immense
landed revenue which they possess in the
<i>East-Indies</i>, it is probable they do not carry there
so much money; yet some must be sent there.
The above five articles are the only ones I know
of, which may render necessary an annual importation
of money. The first of those articles is absolutely
independent of the caprice of any one;
it is always subservient to the quantity of effects
to be put into circulation, as well as to their
price; and can at no time deprive the other
parts of <i>Europe</i> of their share in the mines of
<i>America</i>. The third and fourth are in a manner
included in the first; nor can they, when viewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
separately, be very considerable: The second
alone is truly prodigious, but is likewise subservient
to the demands of that very silver when
wrought, that is to say, converted into some articles
of luxury: But it is necessary to observe,
in regard to this, that great care is taken to find
out purchasers for that metal thus improved
by the hands of the workman, not only in <i>England</i>,
but wherever people can possibly be found
willing to take from her, that part of the precious
balance, which she had taken upon herself, only
in hopes of getting rid of it.</p>

<p>This I think is sufficient to demonstrate the
impossibility of that pretended <i>favourable balance</i>,
amounting, in the space of 75 years, to
162,774,769<i>l.</i> the existence of which many
people imagine to be real, from the statements
of Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>: for, if they would
confine themselves to say, that, in the course
of 75 years, <i>England</i> has profited in trade to
the amount of 162,774,769<i>l</i>. I have proved
much more, since I proved (p. 17 to 22)
that all the benefits which have accrued, and
might now be spent, form together a solid mass
of clear and palpable savings; and that this
mass would now be, without doubt, 332 millions,
instead of 162, had the 180 millions, lent by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the subjects to government, and swallowed up by
the war, been laid out in the improvement of
lands and industry.</p>

<p>As to the inference that might be drawn from
the apparent exportation of 105 millions of money,
during the same period, according to the
above statement, it is also necessary to make an
observation on this matter.</p>

<p>In any grand mercantile operation, where
prompt and certain remittances are required, be
the motive of such operations what it may; if
there goes out of <i>England</i>, we shall suppose,
400,000<i>l.</i> in bullion, this very same bullion,
after the bargain is struck and fulfilled, either
in goods or in bills of exchange, comes back to
<i>London</i>, to resume if necessary, the same course
three weeks afterwards: For the space of 40
years, therefore, the same sum may an hundred
times be placed in the catalogue of exports,
and perfectly answer to a capital of 40 millions,
the place of which it has really supplied: This
is a well-known resource; nothing then can be
concluded in regard to the 105 millions of bullion
exported, according to Sir <i>Charles</i>, but,
that there ever has been, and probably ever
will be, in <i>England</i> all the bullion necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to answer the exigencies of the most unforeseen
and extraordinary negociations of all kinds,
and industry enough to recall in time, that
bullion which had only been given as a pledge.
It is like a jewel worth 100,000 crowns, which,
for the space of 20 years, is said to have passed
ten times backwards and forwards from <i>Paris</i> to
<i>Amsterdam</i>, but finally remained at <i>Amsterdam</i>, by
a reason contrary to that which keeps up the commercial
shuttle between <i>England</i> and <i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p>In order to come as close to the point as it is
necessary, on a matter, besides, of which it is
equally useless and impossible to obtain an exact
knowledge, here follow some facts, the essential
results of which by no means depend on more or
less exaggeration in the exposition either of the
sale, or of the credit.</p>

<p>The period from 1764 to 1773, must be allowed
to have been the most flourishing era of
<i>Great Britain</i>. During those ten years the exportation
of <i>English</i> merchandises into <i>Spain</i>,
has exceeded the importations from <i>Spain</i> into
<i>England</i>, by 5,095,998<i>l.</i> In the same space of
time, the balance of trade between <i>England</i> and
<i>Portugal</i> has been 3,274,133<i>l.</i> in favour of
the former. The two <i>favours</i> united, amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
all together to 8,370,131<i>l.</i>; add thereto the <i>favourable
balances</i> of <i>Madeira</i>, and the <i>Canary</i>
Islands, paid probably in <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>,
amounting, in the same space of time, to
516,863<i>l.</i>—the total presents us with the aggregate
sum of 8,886,994<i>l.</i> which, divided by
10 years, proves an annual balance, <i>in favour</i> of
<i>England</i>, of 888,699<i>l.</i> real money.</p>

<p>The light of probability now begins to dawn
upon me: at least I here find myself at the
source of money; and, as I know, first, that
<i>England</i> must absolutely be provided with a
certain quantity of it, whatever that quantity
may be, for the five articles before mentioned:</p>

<p>Secondly, That she exports, of her own goods,
fifteen times as much as she need to do for that
purpose:</p>

<p>Thirdly, That gold and silver are to <i>Spain</i>
and <i>Portugal</i>, what wines are to <i>France</i>, silks
to <i>Piedmont</i>, hemp and timber to <i>Russia</i>;
and that, in order to procure those different
articles at the easiest rates, they must be
fetched from <i>France</i>, <i>Piedmont</i>, and <i>Russia</i>:</p>

<p>Fourthly and lastly, that <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
stand exactly in the same need of making away
with the surplus of their gold and silver, as
<i>England</i> does of acquiring it, by getting
rid of a surplus of her manufactures: I cannot
therefore entertain the least doubt, but that it is
at <i>Cadiz</i> and <i>Lisbon</i> that <i>England</i> procures all
that gold and silver which is indispensably
wanted for the five operations spoken of; and I
must positively conclude, that there she has
taken the whole quantity which she had occasion
for; but I as positively conclude, that she took
up only so much of it as was wanted, when I see
that it depended entirely upon her to take more,
and that she has not done it: A decisive point,
which I cannot by any means call in question,
when I have convinced myself, by Sir <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>’s statements, that this sum of 888,699<i>l.</i>
which <i>England</i>, if so disposed, might have procured
annually during the ten years above mentioned,
is no more than the balance of 1,785,826<i>l.</i>
in goods exported there, one year with another,
during the same space of time:—For, after all,
why should not <i>England</i> have taken <i>in money</i>
the amount of 897,157<i>l.</i> of <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Portuguese</i>
goods, taken by her ships in return, were
it not that the value of money, as that of all
other kinds of merchandise, is always tyrannically
fixed by the demand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>It seems, therefore, probable enough, that
the money annually imported by <i>England</i>,
during the period aforesaid, does not exceed the
888,698<i>l.</i> of the balance which appears against
<i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Madeira</i>, and the <i>Canary</i>
Islands: But here follows a strong conjecture,
that it is not so considerable as it appears by
those accounts.—It is an uncontroverted fact,
that the article of exportation is always exaggerated
more or less; the man who first bethought
himself of this harmless cunning, fancied that his
own importance would appear more conspicuous
to the nation, by reason of the quantity of goods
which he might seem to export: this is now the
secret of the play-house, every body knows it;
but this practice is in a manner become necessary:
one must unblushingly raise himself above
his level, in order to be thought in his real
place; the only way of deceiving in this respect,
would be to speak the truth; and, in this case,
the deceit would fall on the deceiver himself,
and that just regard which the exporter has a
right to claim, would be lost to him: Add to
this necessary artifice, which is no longer a
cheat, the usual mode adopted in regard to importation,
the value of which is always a little under-rated,
but only a little, because there might
be some inconvenience in cheating Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to excess. With these trifling modifications, I
think <i>England</i> will be found not much above
the <i>par</i> of her <i>quota</i>, in the gold and silver imported
from <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>Now, out of these 6 or 700,000<i>l.</i> in money,
which I believe are really and annually imported
into <i>England</i>, what quantity is sent to foreign
markets,—not, indeed, before its value is considerably
advanced by the workmanship?—But,
if this metal be so precious, why part with it
when once acquired? Why not employ the
workman upon objects, the price of which
would have received a ten-fold increase by his
labour? Why should these continual prophanations
of the sacred metal be permitted? Why
give encouragement to that kind of prostitution
of gildings of all sorts, which daily consume
such quantities of gold? It is said, that in <i>Birmingham</i>
alone, they consume 30,000<i>l.</i> worth
<i>per annum</i>:—And shall it be on a metal thus
lavished away, shall it be on that pretended balance,
that <i>England</i> will build her resources, and
the security of her creditors?—In what consists,
then, the wealth of the nation, that wealth which
is truly independent of all circumstances, and
which will ever be superior to the national wants?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>It consists in any sum whatever, money and
paper currency, which is required to keep in
the utmost activity, 3,000,000 of cultivators,
3,000,000 of tradesmen, and 3,000,000 of other
consumers, as indispensable to realise the value
of the objects by them consumed, as the tradesman
and cultivator are necessary to produce
them:—And if any question should arise on the
number of inhabitants,</p>

<p>It consists in the number of men necessary to
furnish annually exports to the value of fifteen or
sixteen millions:—And if it should be urged that
this exportation is over-rated,</p>

<p>It consists in the number of men capable of
making up that quantity of exports, which is annually
required for a trading navy of 775,024
tons, on the statement of which there cannot
arise a single doubt.</p>

<p>It consists in a population necessary (which
doth really exist, and could not be dispensed
with) to find, without any other inconvenience
but a momentary sensation, the 100,000 seamen
of the royal navy, the 70,000 national soldiers,
and the 3 or 400,000 artificers, and other persons
employed in every way, who, by the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
war, were for some years taken away, from their
daily and useful occupations, some monuments
of which would probably have been transmitted to
posterity, in order to their being employed in all
the accidental operations that were requisite to
carry on those destructive plans, which have left
nothing but a sad remembrance behind: <i>A remembrance,
nevertheless, of which the most allowable
pride should allay the bitterness.</i></p>

<p>It consists also, perhaps, in that revolution,
which must have been effected in the mind of
every intelligent <i>Briton</i>, by the demonstration
grounded on experience, of the impossibility of
doing beyond a few minutes, with a given number
of men, more than that same number is capable
of effecting habitually, and without fatigue.</p>

<p>It consists in the impossibility of not doing,
even to the end of ages, with a given number of
industrious men, all that which the same number
have executed during 80 years, not only without
exhausting themselves, but rather, on the contrary,
still increasing their strength and wealth.</p>

<p>It consists, in fine, in the demonstration
which will become daily more palpable, that labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
alone is the source of that wealth; that the
more the sum of this labour shall augment, the
greater will be the increase of riches; but that
this same labour will not reach its last degree of
activity in <i>England</i>, till it is nearly in the same
state in <i>Siberia</i>; and that there is no great harm
in an <i>English</i> mechanic creating a cultivator in
<i>Siberia</i>, or even in <i>France</i>, provided a <i>Siberian</i>
or <i>French</i> mechanic, create a cultivator or
mechanic in <i>England</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading13"><i>Reflexions on some private Balances of <span class="upright">England</span>,
both of the favourable and disadvantageous
Kind.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>In the small number of disadvantageous balances,
the necessity of which is so grievous to
<i>England</i>, I distinguish that with <i>Russia</i>, which,
in the course of the ten years above mentioned,
amounts upon an average to 825,212<i>l.</i> annually.
This, in fact, is more than enough to swallow
up the 6 or 700,000<i>l.</i> of the favourable balance,
during the same period, against <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>,
the only sources almost of the precious
metals; luckily the expence of <i>Russia</i> in gold
and silver is ascertained, as it is every where
else, first, by the quantity of coin in circulation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
a quantity always proportioned to the price, as
well as to the number of objects to be circulated;
and, secondly, by the degree of ease, riches,
and pomp, which the generality of private faculties
can admit of, in the articles of furniture,
plate, and dress: The introducing of gold and
silver, above the quantity necessary to answer
those various purposes, would, as the case is
every where else, prove entirely useless; for it
can hardly be imagined, that so wise a Princess
as the Sovereign who now holds the sceptre of
<i>Russia</i>, should think of hoarding up, before her
20,000,000 of subjects be as rich, that is, <i>do
produce and consume as much as a similar population
might produce and consume in France or in
England</i>: Now, to hoard up would be the infallible
means to prevent it. Let us now suppose,
that the annual importation of bullion
necessary for the circulation in <i>Russia</i>, amounts
to one half, or even to an equality of what is
wanted by <i>England</i> for the same object:—It is
probable that <i>England</i> contributes thereto no
more than her proportion, as the other maritime
States, who, like her, are obliged to provide
themselves in <i>Russia</i>; and, consequently, the
disadvantageous balance of <i>England</i> with <i>Russia</i>,
can no more demonstrate that the former exports
there annually 825,212<i>l.</i> than the balance in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
favour against <i>Flanders</i>, clearly proved by the
accounts of Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>, can demonstrate
that the above province is by her stripped
of 521,201<i>l.</i> annually.</p>

<p>A publication truly interesting, would be a
work containing a particular account of the
trade of each country, were it only such as that
which Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i> has given on <i>the
trade of England</i>; but though such a treasure
is wanting, yet it appears to me, that to have
a clear idea of such a work, would be sufficient
to foresee what would be the result of it. All
men are alike: one may therefore, without fear
of deceit, suppose in the merchants of every
country, the same attention to swell up the
list of articles which pay no duty, and which
give a trader the petty consequence of a more
considerable exportation; every where might be
found the same exactness, <i>in a contrary sense</i>, in
regard to goods liable to an importation duty;
consequently the balance struck at last would be
in favour of the nation whose accounts should be
then inspected: but deduct from all those favourable
balances, that which might have been farther
declared on the articles which are duty-free; add
to the total of the exports, what has been declared
short of the true amount on the objects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
which must pay; it would then be found that
(the five articles excepted) all is paid literally
without having laid out any cash, and that each
nation is wisely reduced to the only real advantage
of trade, the <i>exchange of want against fancy,
the exchange of one fancy for another, or the exchange
of one want against another want</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In fact, how can it be supposed, that a nation
who should not sell to one, or to six others,
exactly as much as she has purchased from a
seventh, should not be, a little sooner or a little
later, compelled, either to give up a trade
which she must support with real specie, or to
sell that at home for <i>five</i> in cash, which fetched
ten before? Is it not evident, that a nation which
should not purchase from one or six others, as
much as she sells to a seventh, must, sooner or
later, find herself in the necessity, either to hide
her money under ground, or to lower its value,
so far as to sell at home successively for 6, 8,
10, and 20, that which was sold before at 5?
This would exactly have been the case with
<i>Russia</i>, had the annual balance of 825,212<i>l.</i>
been effectually paid to her in coin, either by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
<i>England</i>, or by those who stand on the debtor
side with <i>England</i>, and had the former put it
into circulation, instead of laying out the surplus
of that balance in the purchase of goods
from six other countries, to whom the <i>English</i>
sold articles to a similar amount: Now the <i>Russian</i>
trader does not in <i>Russia</i> charge 20, for that which,
50 years ago, was sold there for 5: the value of
money is not debased there, though <i>Russia</i> has
annually a claim upon <i>England</i> for a balance of
825,212<i>l.</i> and, probably, demands not less
considerable upon the other maritime powers;
<i>Russia</i>, therefore, has cautiously avoided receiving
those different balances in coin.</p>

<p>Besides, money fetches but its price in <i>Flanders</i>,
although, according to Sir <i>Charles</i>, that
province is indebted to <i>England</i> in a yearly balance
of 521,201<i>l.</i>—Nor is money worth above
its price in <i>Germany</i>, though the latter owes
likewise to <i>England</i> a balance of 924,709<i>l.</i> annually.—In
<i>Ireland</i> it goes for no more than its
worth, though there is another balance due by
that kingdom to <i>England</i>, to the yearly amount
of 770,916<i>l.</i>—Nor is it above its value in
<i>France</i>, who owes to <i>England</i> an annual balance
of 108,073<i>l.</i>—Now, if money is every where
nearly of the same value, we must conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
that there does not exist a nation which has not
found in her annual importations of gold and
silver, either considered as money, or as materials
for some articles of luxury, all that she
stood in need of to keep up circulation, and
provide for that degree of luxury, which the
<i>actual</i> degree of her industry <i>requires, as much as
it allows</i>; in this case the final balance, deemed
unexact, that is, in <i>favour of England</i>, has, in
fact, been kept perfectly even. Each has sold
here or there, as much as he has purchased,
and <i>vice versâ</i>; and the prejudice <i>England</i> entertains
on the necessity of a <i>favourable balance</i>,
has not, in practice, dazzled the eyes of the
merchant who carried on her trade: He has
rejected the gold tendered to him, when his profit
upon it would have been but trifling, with as
much judgement as he has, with care, sought
after such goods as could then yield him a
greater benefit.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading14"><i>State of the Balance between <span class="upright">England</span> and
<span class="upright">Holland</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>, in his <i>State of the
English Trade</i>, rates the annual balance due by
<i>Holland</i> to <i>Great Britain</i>, at 1,372,258<i>l.</i> upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
an average of 10 years: This is the most considerable.
There can be no illusion, in regard to
the effect this balance has upon the money in
<i>England</i>; it is well known that it does not increase
it; nay, it is thought that the debt due to
<i>Holland</i>, lessens it annually, not only by the whole
amount of the <i>favourable balance</i> which would
revert to <i>England</i> were she not indebted to the
<i>Dutch</i>, but of one million more, which must be
found to pay them off.</p>

<p>I have already said, and repeated, that in every
circumstance where it is necessary to borrow or
to displace a capital, it is better to borrow, even
at 5 <i>per cent.</i> than to remove a capital which
returns double that sum; and that, on the other
hand, it is more advantageous to lend any sum
abroad upon good security at 5, or even at 3
<i>per cent.</i> than to lend the same sum at home,
where it would yield only 2 <i>per cent.</i> or to bury
it in the abyss of a Bank, whence nothing returns.
Now what proves that <i>Great Britain</i> and
<i>Holland</i> are in this case with regard to each
other, is, that <i>England</i> seldom or never opens
a loan, but what the <i>Dutch</i> take a share in.
What do they give for the purchase? Nothing
more than the surplus of the ordinary
profits arising from a trade, which they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
extend sufficiently to employ the whole amount
of their savings. And why has this part of the
<i>English</i> loan been given up to the <i>Dutch</i> by the
national capitalists? Because the latter could
find in their own trade, susceptible of a farther
extension, a way of employing their capitals to
greater advantage, that is to say, of reaping a
benefit superior to the interest offered by the
loan: How can this be doubted, when we see
that the loan falls into the hands of a small number
of merchants, who soon afterwards make
over their debt? Would they transfer it to any
one, were not the interest it brings in, interest
secured by the nation, inferior to the ordinary
profits of their commerce?</p>

<p>Therefore, if the balance due to the <i>Dutch</i> is
thought <i>burdensome</i>, only in the supposition that
it serves to pay <i>burdensome</i> interests, it cannot
be looked upon in the same light, when the matter
rests upon a debt, by which the borrower
clears a benefit superior to the interest that he has
to pay.—I shall present this question under another
point of view.</p>

<p>In the war which was terminated by the treaty
of <i>Paris</i>, the most considerable part of the debt
contracted for its support, was acquired by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
<i>Dutch</i>: Why so? Because the <i>English</i>, carrying
on, without any opposition, an exclusive trade
with every part of the world open to them
alone, found therein the opportunity of employing
their capitals to a far greater advantage,
than that held out by government in the interest
of the loan. During the last war, on the contrary,
the <i>English</i>, being more narrowly circumscribed
in regard to their commercial operations,
by a navy, the possibility of which they did not
even suspect, much less its real existence, and being
kept more circumspect by a new system which
opened a free navigation to all the powers not
involved in war, thought themselves happy to
find, in the national loan, an employment for
that portion of their capitals, which, from circumstances,
was become useless. The interests of
the last debt are then due and paid within, and
by <i>Great Britain</i>; but will it be said, that
<i>England</i> would not be so rich, were the 3 millions
additional interest, with which she is burdened,
due to <i>Holland</i>, and had the <i>English</i>, instead
of employing their capitals, as they have
done, in support of the last war, made use
of them in the same profitable manner as in the
year 1755? had that money, for instance,
been laid out in the improvement of their waste
lands in <i>Europe</i>, <i>whilst Dutch cash should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
fought against French money, to determine how
many European nations ought to be permitted to
carry to North America, the goods of the other
parts of the globe</i>!</p>

<p>As to the full acquittal in money, <i>real</i> and <i>effective</i>,
of the 2,000,000<i>l.</i> interest, due to <i>Holland</i>
for her previous loan, it is improbable, impossible,
and useless.</p>

<p><i>It is improbable</i>, because <i>Holland</i>, being already
overstocked with money, and carefully intent
on getting rid of her surplusage in this particular,
at the first opportunity of placing it
with security, would still lower the price of it at
home, were she to increase its mass; and that,
on the contrary, whilst <i>Holland</i> takes in goods
instead of money, she keeps up the interest of
the one, by securing to herself a benefit upon the
other.</p>

<p><i>It is impossible</i>, because <i>England</i> importing
bullion from <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, to the amount
only of one third, and being very cautious, as
observed before, not to import more than <i>one
third</i> of what she owes to the <i>Dutch</i>, and this,
not to pay them, but because this third answers
sufficiently to the five articles of which I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
spoken before;—<i>England</i>, then, cannot give to
the <i>Dutch</i> what she has not received from another,
and which she has not of her own.</p>

<p><i>It is useless</i>, in fine, because all accounts whatever
are balanced with more ease, in the age we
live in, by bills of exchange, than with cash, and
because the claims of <i>Holland</i> are more naturally
paid off, by another debt due to <i>Great Britain</i>, for
the produce of her exports to some other parts of
<i>Europe</i>, from whence the <i>Dutch</i> carefully avoid,
as much as possible, to import any thing but
merchandise.</p>

<p>But <i>would it not be better to owe nothing to
foreign nations</i>? For to this one point we ought
to confine all the lamentations about <i>Dutch</i> creditors.</p>

<p>The above question, so apparently simple, so
readily to be resolved in the affirmative, would
grow perhaps more intricate, were it ushered in
by some previous queries, which might permit us
to foresee the effect of the national wish, when
accomplished, if it could be obtained by the
easiest answer that could be given; for the case,
no doubt, is not to examine, whether it would
not be better to have borrowed, without being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
obliged to return, than to pay an interest after
the money has been borrowed. In the state of
things, the question alluded to, to be fair and
within the pale of common sense, must mean
nothing more than this: <i>Would it not be better,
that the proprietors of the two millions interest,
paid to a foreign nation, should make their residence
in England?</i> And in this case it leads us, by
degrees, to the following query: <i>Would it not be
better, if all and every man in the world, who has
money to spare, should come to spend it in London?</i>
Then indeed <i>London</i> would be a dear place to
live in! And this is, methinks, the most dreaded
effect arising from taxes. <i>O ye, whose covetousness
knows no limits but the bounds of the earth!
do ye pretend to be the sole inhabitants thereof?</i>
Can ye draw off the capitalists of a country,
without completing its ruin? Can ye effect its
ruin, without losing both that portion which the
produce of your soil secures to you in the produce
of that nation’s industry, and the share
which the produce of your industry has secured
for you in those of her soil?</p>

<p>What then appears to me to be the result of
this <i>fatal</i> interest of two millions due annually to
<i>Holland</i>?—That the latter is essentially interested,
not in an increase of the power of <i>England</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
who might make a bad use of it; not in
an increase of specie in <i>England</i>, which, by lowering
its value, must compel her to return that
of the <i>Dutch</i>, already so much disparaged in
their country; but to a further extension of the
<i>English</i> trade, or rather of the general commerce,
which can alone, by advancing constantly, and
every where, the quantity and price of the
objects that are to circulate, increase in the same
proportion the necessity of the <i>instruments</i> indispensable
to every kind of circulation and undertaking,
and keep up in every part, <i>for the
interest of Spain and Portugal, as well as for that
of Holland</i>, the value of the sign intended for a
general representation, which <i>Holland</i> in her proportion
will ever have in greater plenty than all
other nations, thanks to the narrow limits of her
territories, and to the manners of her inhabitants,
which, in all probability, are the consequence
of that limitation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading15"><i>Balance of <span class="upright">France</span> with <span class="upright">England</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Of all the balances of <i>England</i> summed up by
Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>, that which is most to be
wondered at every where but in <i>Japan</i> and <i>China</i>,
where foreign trade is but poorly encouraged,
is the balance between <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>, these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
two nations being parted, as they are, only by a
simple brook.</p>

<p>The wonder cannot but increase, if we consider
with what eagerness those two countries are
intent upon improving their trade.</p>

<p>The wonder will still increase, when it is observed,
that the <i>French</i> carry to the highest pitch
their rage for <i>English</i> modes, whilst the <i>English</i>
experience the same kind of frenzy for <i>French</i>
fashions.</p>

<p>The wonder must increase still further, when
it is observed, that the same nations, in possession
of the most active and most intelligent industry, are
also possessed of all the cash necessary to give an
additional activity to that <i>industry</i>, which might
be required to carry on a branch of trade, as it
were, at their door, but which is neglected, out
of regard for old and absurd prejudices.</p>

<p>Still must the wonder increase, if it is observed,
that a first capital of 200,000<i>l.</i> laid out in that
trade by the two nations, would occasion in
both, more work in cultivation, as well as in the
arts, than 600,000<i>l.</i> which each of them might
employ in a trade to <i>China</i>, if it were possible to
lay out such a sum upon it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>The wonder will be still greater, when we consider
that, <i>by favouring, with equal care, the imports
and exports to and from one country into the
other, the two nations would, without the least
inconvenience, acquire the means of increasing the
revenue of their customs respectively, according to
their wants, by agreeing mutually upon a tarif, which
would be rated upon the average of those wants</i>;
a tarif, which the rest of <i>Europe</i> might adapt to
its circumstances, if it were the general intention
to increase, every where, the revenue of the
State and the industry of the people, in a like
proportion.</p>

<p>This is certainly what the two nations might
have compassed. That which follows, is what
they have done.</p>

<p>In the year 1699 the exports of <i>England</i> to
<i>France</i> amounted to 287,050<i>l.</i> and her imports
from <i>France</i> to 94,641<i>l</i>:—</p>

<p>In 1773, the period at which Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>
closes his statements, the exports from
<i>England</i> were rated at 285,776<i>l.</i> and the imports
from <i>France</i> at only 44,484<i>l.</i>—On this
the enthusiastic admirers of the Balance <i>in favour</i>
bless their stars that their country imports now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
50,157<i>l.</i> less in <i>French</i> goods, than it did in 1699,
and that, in order to secure this advantage, <i>England</i>
experiences no other damage than that the <i>French</i>
are fallen in their imports from <i>England</i> only
1274<i>l.</i> since the year 1699.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading16"><i>Further Reasons why all Ideas of a favourable Balance
in Money, different from that which I have
supposed, should be rejected.</i></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Great-Britain</i> is not the only nation
that claims a right to that kind of <i>favour</i>,
which would reduce all <i>Europe</i>, in all transactions,
to the use of paper-money; but I only
speak of <i>England</i> in this place.</p>

<p>Money is not hid under ground in a country
where administration is convinced, both of the
impossibility of the people paying exorbitant
taxes, without proportionable riches, and of
the impossibility of being as rich as is requisite
for the discharge of enormous taxes, when
individuals are compelled to appear less rich,
that they may be less burdened with imposts.</p>

<p>Money is not laid under ground in a country,
where the smallest sum, as it were, equally with
the largest, may be placed most securely, till the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
very moment, when, led by fancy or want, one
may think well to withdraw it, and which, from
the time when it has been placed, to that of recalling
it, produces nevertheless a sure interest,
which never was delayed a single minute; an interest,
which is a matter neither of reproach nor
of shame.</p>

<p>Money is not laid under ground in a country,
where the reputation of being rich exposes not the
subject to an arbitrary taxation, nor to demands
equally ruinous, to informations, extortions, or at
least to some injustice in case of a refusal.</p>

<p>Money is not laid under ground in a country,
where regard is the appendage not only of wealth,
but of credit also, which carries the appearance
of, and can procure the former.</p>

<p>Nor is money hid under ground in a country,
where it shews the value of a man as positively as
that of a piece of goods; in a country, where it
is frankly said, <i>this man is worth a million</i>;
whether this expression be made use of to signify
that the possessor of a million is, at least, by the
whole extent of that million, far from being
guilty of meanness and injustice, or that it be
understood that nothing but the offer of another
million could tempt him to commit anything base<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
or unjust. Money is never buried under ground
in a country, where it acts so essential a part; it
cannot then be its fate in <i>England</i>: all the money
in the possession of <i>England</i> stands in full
evidence; it consists,—1st, in objects of private
luxury, the quantity of which is by no means
extravagant;—2dly, in the mass of cash in circulation.
Now this very <i>mass</i> is despotically
determined by the number of affairs transacted,
and likewise by the prices and quantity
of the property which is to be circulated;
yet this mass is, perhaps, in <i>England</i>
one half less than it would prove any where else,
supposing the same objects to be attained; that
universal <i>mobile</i> is too justly appreciated there,
to be lavished, that is to say, to be <i>turned into
cash</i>, beyond what is required to give credit to
the paper currency substituted to <i>cash</i>.</p>

<p>I shall therefore ask, In what public funds
abroad the <i>English</i> merchants vest annually the
four or five millions of that pretended <i>favourable</i>
balance in money, since they do not bury
it at home?—There might, it is true, still exist
another resource; the general balance is only
the aggregate of all private balances.⸺But
is it very certain that, upon an average, the
private balances of all the merchants in <i>Europe</i>,
who correspond with <i>England</i>, are annually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
charged by one fourth of the amount accruing
from that correspondence? For if the <i>English</i>
send them 16 every year, and every year import
only 12, their correspondents are consequently
indebted to them annually 4 more than they were
the preceding year.</p>

<p>The <i>favourable balance</i>, as it is commonly
understood, is then a mere chimera, which, if
realised, would produce no other effect than to
advance, at some period or other, the price of
a pound of bread to that of a pound weight of
gold; yet it results, methinks, from the exports
of <i>England</i>, almost trebled within a century,
that each nation, with whom the former has trebled
her trade, has increased her own, at least,
by the whole amount of the balance due by her
to <i>England</i>; for it is beyond a doubt, that one
must have three times more to sell, in order to be
able to purchase constantly, and pay three times
more than he used to do. But from this principle
may it not be inferred also, that every
nation, wishing to increase her trade, is interested
in an increase of the commerce of all those with
whom she means to correspond?—If, in order to
reduce into practice, if to establish on the most
equitable and most solid foundation, a system so
truly advantageous to society, Nature had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
more to combat than private <i>cupidities</i>—they
balance each other. But how many national
prejudices, how many maxims sacred to
each nation, how many absurd regulations,
springing from those very maxims and prejudices,
is she not obliged to modify, as it were, underhand,
in their effects! What a number of
smugglers does that good mother employ, for the
purpose of bringing all things nearer to that
<i>equilibrium</i>, from which many are still persuaded
it is so very material to deviate!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading17"><i>Equilibrium necessary in all things.—On the surest
means of establishing it.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>It is a difficult matter to guard against a
prejudice in favour of liberty, when we consider,
that, thanks to the freedom which has always
very generally prevailed in those parts of
Science, wherein policy disdained to restrain it,
we have been taught to weigh air, before any precise
idea was obtained on the rule of proportion,
which ought to regulate matters of exchange.
Every thing, in this last particular, is even still
merely mechanical; and perhaps if the matter
were thoroughly examined, it would be found
that there is never too much, nor too little in one
of the scales of the balance, but from an effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the means devised to establish or preserve the
Equilibrium. I do not pretend to lay down, for an
absolute principle, that the hand of man, like that
of the harpies, is only capable of poisoning whatever
comes within its reach, and that the wisest
conduct would be, to keep it with care from
every thing that one should wish to preserve from
corruption; such a proposition would, no doubt,
prove rather too general; yet one cannot help
observing, that there are but few countries where
administration has not often, owing to the grossest
ignorance, or some principle of injustice, or of a cupidity
almost equally blind, restrained some very
lucrative <i>cultures</i>, to which the nature of the soil
and of the climate would have given a perfection
that could be attained no where else; or have not
encouraged some costly produce, to which Nature
refuses those qualities which she liberally bestows
under another sky.</p>

<p>Neither can one refrain from remarking also,
that from those regulations, and from many
more of the same kind relative to manufactories,
no other effect can result than that of
buying up at home, very dear, and often of a
bad or indifferent quality, that which might be
purchased abroad of an excellent kind, and at a
cheaper rate, and which might be paid for with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the productions of the earth and industry, better
suited to the climate of the purchaser.</p>

<p>It is also observed, that, without the interference
of administration or of philosophy, the balance
between want and the relative quantity of
the different productions of the earth, is always,
upon a medium, admirably supported by the sole
interest of the cultivator, ever perfectly and solely
guided by the common demand for each of these
productions.</p>

<p>It is also remarked, that a second balance, and
a very necessary one, between the mean price of
those different productions, is also mechanically
established, on the difference of labour and of
the capitals, which the same cultivator lays out
upon each of them, without any other motive
but that of employing with discernment, his hands
and his capital, to derive from them the greatest
benefit. He never thinks of restoring the equilibrium
between the general prices, when the
price of the product A has fallen, and when a
continued advance on the product B invites
him to multiply the latter, by transferring to its
cultivation, a more considerable share of his
labour and of his capital. Nor does he think
of it, when laying out new supplies of labour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
money if the price of the product B keeps up
whilst that of the product A goes on increasing;
he does not think of it; and yet, without any
other reason or motive than his own interest, he
restores that necessary equilibrium. Much less
still does he think that an increase maintained
in the price of one object, without diminution
in that of other articles, bespeaks an increase
of the general consumption, which soon must
raise the price of every thing. Nay, it is very
probable that he will not take notice that he
<i>sells</i> all his goods at a higher rate, and that he
will soon complain of the general advance in
the price of all those which he buys, because his
interest is his only guide: but this interest is
opposed by that of industry; and from this
clashing, in spite of the two opponents, arises a
new balance, more loaded, no doubt, than the
first, but not less necessary, not less equitable,
and yet no one has meddled with it.</p>

<p>All these things may be easily observed; but
what ought to be more particularly attended to,
and what is most overlooked, is the impossibility
of ascertaining the difference between the hand-labour
and capitals to which we owe the productions
of the earth, the knowledge of which is
within the reach of every one, and the labour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
capitals to which we owe the productions of industry,
in which the workmanship of an article
often constitutes the half, and sometimes 99
hundredths of its value: it is a disadvantage
against which agriculture cannot be effectually
protected but by a competition, which can be
the result only of the greatest freedom. The
absolute <i>passiveness</i>, which, in the above stated
circumstances, is sufficient, on the part of Government,
to effect the greatest good, appears
here indispensable, to avoid acts of injustice.
Why should the trading part complain of that
<i>passiveness</i>, whilst a number of cultivators, proportioned
to that of the artisans, produce in the
State a revenue equal to the maintenance and
support of industry? Now the fact appears the
more certain, as, upon the least reflexion, one
may be sensible, that if an epidemic disorder
should break out amongst the husbandmen only,
and thus deprive cultivation of one half of its
proper number of hands, the survivors would not
fail to increase the price of their labour, and the
farmer that of his farm, by so much as would
indemnify agriculture for the loss which she might
have sustained, and that the advance in her
prices would fall off only in proportion as the
handicraftsmen without employment, by the
uselessness of that portion of the produce of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
industry, hitherto consumed by the cultivators
who fell victims to the disease, would themselves
turn cultivators; an operation which
would soon restore the proper balance between
the two revenues, as well as between the prices
of labour, from which all kinds of produce originate.
Let the effects of the disease be transferred
from the cultivators to the handicraftsmen,
the same manœuvre will be played off by those
who preside over industry.</p>

<p>Should another reason be wanted to strengthen
my argument in its most essential part, I could
adduce an incontestable fact, as little controverted
in <i>France</i> as it is in <i>England</i>, namely,
that in both countries the whole of the landed
property does not yield three fourths of what it
ought to produce.—Then, either the respective
industry of the two nations ransoms agriculture,
and binds her up, without being suspected of doing
so, to that state of mediocrity to which she is reduced;
in which case, single out of your regulations,
those which favour industry at the expence
of cultivation, and endeavour to expunge
them, since agriculture stands clearly in want both
of hands and capitals; or your industry and agriculture
are neither of them nearly arrived to that
degree of perfection which they are calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
reach; that is to say, you have not the number
of cultivators which your land can nourish, nor
of course, so many artificers as your land can
maintain; in this case also, revise your regulations;
there is not one of them which does not affect
your agriculture in a direct or indirect manner;
by her you must begin: cultivators, unthinkingly
and without regret, give birth to a race of
artisans;—it is, on the contrary, as it were
in spite of industry, and by a kind of reaction
which she spares no endeavours to retard,
that cultivators are produced by artisans. <i>Never
will industry lay out a shilling upon the land if she
can employ it in any other enterprise.</i></p>

<p>But, would the inland trade, without which
agriculture cannot subsist, flourish, if foreign
commerce should not be encouraged in a
particular manner? And were any circumstances
whatever, combined together so as to occasion
such an alteration in the price of necessaries,
as would deprive industry of the proper
means to support abroad a competition which
cannot possibly subsist but by an equality of
means; would it not then become necessary
for government, to shew a special favour to
commerce, intrusted with the care of that
competition? <i>The manufacturers, in all countries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
insist so forcibly on such a necessity! The ruling
powers in every nation are so convinced of the truth
of the above maxim!</i></p>

<p>This question, truly important, requires some
details on the different causes productive of the
alteration in the prices.</p>

<p>Although I may often appear, in the following
suppositions, to lose sight of the revenue arising
from industry, and pay attention to that of the
land only, we must not forget the mechanical
principle, or rather the force of Nature, who,
sooner or later, in spite of all the subtilty of man,
keeps an exact balance between those two sources
of national wealth, and causes all the revolutions
of the one to be unavoidably felt by the other.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading18"><i>Various Causes of the Alteration in the Prices.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>As long as we shall suppose, in a country standing
by itself, the same products, the same consumption,
the same quantity of money, the
same freedom, no reason can ever be assigned
for an increase or falling-off in the price of any
article generally known, and of general use;
but,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<h3><i>Second Hypothesis</i>,</h3>

<p>Let us suppose, that population is doubled as
well as the revenue; no alteration can certainly
take place in the real value of things;—that value
will remain for each article, the same as it
was before; that is, <i>the sum of the labour
requisite for the production of that article</i>:<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
neither will the relative value undergo any
change; the quantity of labour known, or supposed,
in two different objects of a certain consumption,
will remain, as at first, the sole criterion
for fixing the difference of value in the one
and the other. The essential relation of general
correspondence between the wants, and
the real resources, remaining also the same, there
can likewise be no real difference in the situation
of any individual whatever; if there are every
where two <i>consumers</i> to one, the same increase
will be found in the number of <i>productors</i>. The
only palpable, and unavoidable alteration, always
grievous when it is sudden, is that which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
in the present hypothesis, must have taken place
in the nominal value, that is to say, in the money-price
of every thing; for the quantity of
coin which was in circulation, being always the
same in that country, standing by itself as we have
supposed, and without mines, whilst the objects
representing the said quantity, had successively
doubled, it had been indispensable, successively,
either by degrees, or by starts, to
come to the point of giving for 2 in money,
that which could not be given before for less
than 4, or rather of denominating 4, that same
quantity of money which hitherto had been denominated
2.—If you look for a precedent of the
first effects of a disproportion too considerable
or too rapid, between the wants and the demands,
or between the mass of coin in circulation,
and the number of articles to be circulated,
it will be found, in the revolutions which took
place in <i>England</i>, during the space of two years
<i>only</i>, 1288, 1289, the quarter of wheat rose
from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> then to 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 12<i>s.</i> came
down again to 2<i>s.</i> was then raised all at once to
20<i>s.</i> and fell at last to 16<i>s.</i> where it seemed
to support itself for some years (see the excellent
<i>Inquiry</i> of Mr. <i>Smith</i>, <i>into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations</i>); this is the man truly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
capable of dissecting, as it were, that subject, of
which I can, at best, but mangle the <i>epidermis</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Third Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>To remedy the evil in such circumstances,
how many expedients are tried, which only serve
to increase it! How many avowed depredations
upon pretended usurers, before the Sovereign
boldly ventures to partake with them in the
public execration by ordering a re-coinage,
which, under the same denomination, will give
but a part of the weight, or of the quality of the
former coin! Yet this cannot be avoided. But by
ascertaining, as we have done before, a two-fold
increase in the revenue, and supposing one
million and a half to have been sufficient to the circulation
of the first revenue; if the Prince with
his 1,500,000<i>l.</i> instead of a coinage of three millions,
should have struck only 2,400,000<i>l.</i>—after
some fluctuation, the balance will be restored
between the price or nominal value of the
negociable articles, and the quantity of money
in circulation;—but what had been sold for 5
heretofore, will then go for 4; the prices
will have fallen one fifth, and the circulation
will be clogged:—But above all, it should be observed,
that <i>no one will be the poorer, notwithstanding
the diminution of the nominal value</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<h3><i>Fourth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>If the re-coinage has been in the proportion
necessary to re-establish exactly the former
facility in all the channels of circulation,
the former prices will return after the inevitable
fluctuations; the quarter of wheat, for
instance, which at some period of the revolution,
will have been raised to 20<i>s.</i> will fall back
to 5<i>s.</i> as it was at the beginning, although the
shilling contains only half the silver that it contained
at that time, 130 grains we shall say,
instead of the 260 or 264 it contained in the
year 1300.</p>

<h3><i>Fifth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>Now let us suppose, what has happened in all
countries, that the Prince and his Ministers have
laid hold of the opportunity, the former, to pay
the debts he had incurred in the time of national
distress and confusion, the latter, to procure a
more rapid increase of their fortunes, and that,
with the 1,500,000<i>l.</i> supposed in circulation, they
have struck 6 millions, instead of the 3 wanted
to answer the real increase of the revenues and
of population;—certainly when the calm returns,
10<i>s.</i> will be the price of a quarter of wheat,
which sold for 5<i>s.</i> in the <i>first hypothesis</i>;—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
most decisive argument this, for the manufacturer
to sell at 8 that very cloth which went
for 4, and an uncontrovertible ground of right
in the working people to charge 4<i>d.</i> for that
which before they performed at 2<i>d.</i>—In
these two points center all the practical inferences
in which any individual in the State can
be concerned: yet the shilling will contain only
65 grains of silver, instead of 260;—and if the
price of every thing be doubled, it is not on account
of the shilling containing only 65 grains
in lieu of 260, since, upon this principle, the
quarter of wheat must have fetched 20<i>s.</i> instead
of 10<i>s.</i>—but it is because, in all cases, there are
two pieces of money to answer the purpose of one,
and that <i>it was necessary, in order that the second
might acquire one half of its former value, that the
first should lose that very half</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Sixth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>At this period, let it be supposed, that an
epidemical distemper sweeps off three-fourths of
the inhabitants, and consequently takes away
as much from the revenue:—After the terrors
usual in such cases, and a score of prophecies,
foretelling that Doomsday is at hand, yet will
it appear that the world is not destroyed: it will
also appear, that the epidemical disorder has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
not carried off the money, and that it would be
wrong not to make use of it.—The specie must
of course, lose nearly three fourths of its value if
the whole should continue in circulation, because
4 pieces will present themselves to do the office
which 1 could perform before the time of the
distemper;—the quarter of wheat, at first rated
at 5 shillings, sunk to 4 in the <i>second hypothesis</i>,
then sold for 10 in the <i>fifth</i>, will in
the present one, rise up to 40, <i>without any one
growing richer or poorer for it; for</i>, most assuredly,
<i>the price of labour will have increased in
proportion to that of its own produce</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Seventh Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>The effect would have been the same, if, instead
of the distemper just supposed, the general
enthusiasm on the discovery of a gold or silver
mine, had induced the Sovereign to add to
the circulation three times the quantity of specie
which had hitherto been sufficient.</p>

<h3><i>Eighth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>In the supposition of an event the most opposite
to that of an epidemic disease, viz. of the revenue
being increased one half, one third, nay, three
fourths, if you please, as well as the population;
yet the mine yielding a great deal above what is
necessary to answer to an increase in all kinds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and the Sovereign being resolved upon a recoinage
of the specie, on principles entirely different from
the former, that is, by preserving exactly the
same number, standard, and denomination of the
coin; the number, because it is sufficient; the
denomination, because there must be one, and
that it is indifferent which it bears; and the
standard, because there is no further danger in
fixing it; but, by advancing the weight of a
shilling from 65 to 86 grains, there will certainly
be no alteration in the prices; the wheat will
keep up at 40 shillings, and other articles in the
same proportion;—and <i>none will be richer or
poorer for it</i>, although, at the price of 40<i>s.</i> the
quarter of wheat, they give, without hesitation,
3440 grains of silver for an article for which
they gave 650 only, previous to the epidemic
disease, or the opening of the mine, which has
produced the same effect.</p>

<h3><i>Ninth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>When such revolutions are brought about by
slow degrees, no one is sensible either of the effect,
or of the cause; but, at last, both are attended
to. Let us then suppose, that the generality of
the people reflect that gold and silver, considered
as coin, derive all their value from imagination;—that
money is, strictly speaking, nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
than a medium adopted to facilitate the division
and transport of all other kinds of property;—that
it is but a sign, the place of which may be
easily supplied by any other, which by general
consent may be honoured with the same distinction,
or ordered for the same use;—that its
value, in this point of view, rises or falls unavoidably,
according to its quantity, <i>without
influencing the intrinsic or relative value of the articles
it represents, a value constantly determined by
the sum of the labour that produces them</i>, just as
their relative, <i>common</i> quantity follows, servilely
and closely, the demand.—All these remarks
cannot prevent us from observing a value
far more essential in gold and silver, considered
as metals susceptible of all the forms that can
be useful, or can please the eye, while the nature
and texture of their parts secure them from
accidents equally disagreeable and dangerous,
to which all other metals are liable: we should
not therefore be surprised, if some reflexions,
suggested by wisdom and humanity, were to
lead us to that point which first originated in
the extravagance of ambition, and the rage of
politics; I mean, that, after having considered
that no manner of good was produced by that
disparagement of coin, which always resulted
from its multiplication, and that the health of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
man was, on the contrary, interested in putting to
a better use those metals, the quantity of which,
being doubled in circulation, only served to
double the price of every thing;—we should
not be surprised, I say, not only that nothing
was spared to encourage the goldsmith’s trade,
but even, that half of the coin was melted
down, and transformed into plate, and the <i>deficit</i>
supplied by a quantity of <i>paper-currency</i>, answering
to that of the coin thus employed; a <i>paper-currency</i>,
which it would be sufficient to distinguish
by some mark or token agreed upon, to
give it in circulation, exactly the same properties
as that part of the metals which was transferred
to a more advantageous purpose.</p>

<p>In regard to the danger of paper-currency increasing
above the quantity wanted, it is as little
to be feared, and its superabundance would
soon be made as sensible by its effect, as that
of a superfluity of coin.—If you double the mass
of money intended for circulation, how will
you prevent such articles as sold for 4 only,
from rising to 8, or the additional 4 from becoming
useless?—And if paper-currency be in
question, how will you prevent the extravagantly-avaricious
wretch, who envies others the enjoyments
he denies to himself, how can you prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
him, I say, from observing that paper rots in the
ground, and that to bury his wealth he must exchange
it for cash?—how will you prevent this
want of money, immediately felt, from destroying,
without resource, the credit which that mass of
buried money had hitherto given to paper-currency?
So long, therefore, as the paper keeps up
its credit, one may rest assured that the public is
not over-loaded with it. I shall, in the sequel,
venture some reflexions on the true cause of
that part of the increase in prices, which is
attributed to the quantity of paper-currency in
circulation; contenting myself here with a recapitulation
of what I have just said on the different
causes of the alteration in prices, according
to the foregoing hypothesis, by concluding,</p>

<p>First, That a nation which should rejoice in
being possessed (for the convenience of covetous
individuals) of a <i>vortex</i>, into which they could
cast, at pleasure, without profit, but also without
anxiety, an immense treasure, which was
the produce of the pains taken by so many
useful and industrious hands, would, in fact,
only congratulate herself on being possessed of
the effectual means of robbing the present and
succeeding ages, of all the advantages that must
have accrued from the use made of that money,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
<i>in any part of the world</i>, where it might have
produced, and encouraged a new branch of industry,
<i>the reaction of which would have turned to
the profit of the nation in possession of such <span class="upright">vortex</span>.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, That a nation, which should rejoice
in being the owner of an immense quantity
of coin in circulation, would, in fact, congratulate
herself on that want of credit which renders
such quantity indispensable.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That as soon as government, in such
a nation, should have solemnly given up the
right, supposed to be unalienable, of paying its
debts, from no other motive but that of extreme
honour and benevolence, the nation
might then part with half her coin, and without
impeding the circulation, increase her enjoyments
and her wealth, which can be nothing more than
<i>the total of her annual labour, together with the
monuments still subsisting of the labour of preceding
years</i>: a total, which could not but increase
in the case now supposed.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That, in regard to the coin, the
most wretched paper-factory, assisted with that
credit which is founded, not on kindness, but
on justice and interest, is far preferable to the
richest mine in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Fifthly, That the difference in the real value
between one article and another, is only the difference
of the labour which produces it; and that
<i>all regulation, tending to throw a veil on the quantity
of labour contained in one article, is unjust</i>;
since it turns to the prejudice of any individual
in the community, <i>who is not the author of this unknown
labour</i>.</p>

<p>Sixthly, That the nominal price of the <i>essential</i>
article, to which that of the others must finally
revert and conform, fixed at first by its proportion
in the quantity of articles to be represented,
and by the divisions and subdivisions
of the mass of money then existing for that use,
this nominal <i>common</i> price will certainly rise or
fall, constantly, and <i>without the least inconvenience</i>,
just as that first quantity of coin shall cease
to answer, by more or by less, to the quantity of
the objects of which it was calculated to transfer
the property.</p>

<p>Seventhly, That, supposing it to be a fact,
proved incontestably by the mint-registers, and
the average price at <i>Windsor</i>, that from the year
1300 to 1309, wheat, at its highest rate, was not
above 7<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter, the shilling weighing 264
grains of silver, which made the quarter come
only to 1848 grains; that in the year 1551, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
same sold for 8<i>s.</i> the shilling containing then
only 60 grains, which made it exactly 160 grains
<i>per</i> quarter; and that the same sells now, I will say,
at 40<i>s.</i> the shilling containing 86 grains, which
is 3440 grains for a quarter of wheat; yet,
from these facts no inference can be drawn that
could affect any individual whatever, unless it
should be proved, that money makes part of our
food, or that it is impossible, at this present time,
to procure, with any <i>given</i> labour, more or less
wheat than that identical labour could procure at
that period.</p>

<p>Eighthly, That the <i>real</i> difference between 1848
grains of silver, and 3440, which is perceivable
between the prices of the years 1300 and 1785,
would not even be sufficient, were it considered
by itself, to invalidate, or confirm this futile proposition,
that the mass or stock of money is
nearly doubled in <i>England</i>; for we have already
found, that, supposing the case of an epidemic
distemper, which would have carried off three
fourths of the people, and consequently reduced
the revenue in the same proportion, the price of
every thing must have increased fourfold, if the
three fourths of the coin had not been buried
under ground; we have seen, on the contrary, that
it has been possible to withdraw from circulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
half of the current cash, and make good this
substraction in a very advantageous manner, by
introducing scraps of paper in its stead, without
making any alteration in the general prices, or
in the least affecting the circumstances of any
one, poor or rich, unless some collateral incident
should intervene to bring about a
change; and the least reflexion will convince
us, that the mass of specie might be quadruplicated
in a nation, without any material variation
in the prices, <i>if the sum of labour, and of its products,
as well as of the consumption, should augment
proportionably</i>.</p>

<p>But, in stating that the only—the infallible
reason for the variations of <i>common</i> prices in
the foregoing hypotheses, is the change of proportion
between the mass of specie, or of the paper-currency
which represents it, and the articles
of which the one, or the other, is to transfer
the property, there is no inconsistency in
persisting to pretend that taxes add to the former
prices, both the amount of the impost, and the
profit due to the trader who advances it. But, in
both cases the progress is different: in the former,
it is the quantity of the specie actually in
being which necessitates and fixes the prices; in
the latter, it is the necessary advance in the prices,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
that <i>necessitates</i> and <i>fixes</i> the quantity of specie,
or paper-money which is substituted to it.—Luckily,
as we have already observed, it has
been enough for <i>England</i> to find, once for all,
money to the amount of 5 millions sterling,
(cash and paper) for discharging to the end of
time, the interest of a debt computed at 238
millions, the same currency.—But upon a supposition
that the debt incurred by <i>France</i>, from the
year 1774, should amount to 15 or 1600 millions
<i>tournois</i>, and the yearly produce of <i>French</i> industry
in all its branches, (at the common rate of
1775) be of 2,400,000,000<i>l.</i>—the interest of
80 millions and upwards, to be paid for such a
debt, requires an adequate increase of taxes:—now,
80 millions <i>tournois</i> constitute about the
30th part of the annual revenue produced by
<i>French</i> industry, the nominal value of which
must be increased by those taxes;—but as paper-money
does not supply in <i>France</i> the place of
cash, it has been, of course, necessary to augment
by one 30th, the mass of specie, which
proved sufficient before the rise in the prices,
occasioned by the impost;—this mass, it is said,
was rated at 2,400,000,000 of <i>livres</i>, the 30th
part of which is 66,666,666 13<i>s.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> <i>tournois</i>,
a very considerable sum indeed; but nevertheless
nothing more has been necessary, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
any inquietude on the subject, than to
procure that sum, once for all; and, <i>once for
all likewise</i>, to add thereto the effect of some
re-actions, of which I shall speak presently;
nothing more, I say, was wanted to secure, in
an indefensible manner, the interest of a loan of
1500 millions, and to secure it so as to raise
in the minds of the holders of stock to so immense
an amount, no other apprehension than
that of their being reimbursed.</p>

<p>Some will say, perhaps, “this reasoning is
frivolous, and founded on the absurd supposition
of a general combination, a kind of universal
conspiracy, in order to raise the price of
every thing proportionably to the <i>taxes</i>.” I
know that such a combination, such a conspiracy
is impossible; I know that there is not in
<i>France</i> a single edict, nor any particular act of
parliament in <i>England</i>, to enforce, or even to
permit it; but I am sensible that such an act, and
such an edict, would be perfectly useless, when I see,
that in either of those countries there is not a rational
being, capable of reflexion, who will not
say, <i>Taxes occasion a dreadful advance in the prices
of every thing</i>: it is true that the order is sometimes
inverted, and then the cry is—<i>How cruel it is that
the price of every article is increased, whilst the taxes
diminish our means of purchase!</i>—But if every article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
rises in a due proportion, we must conclude
that there is no alteration in the state of
the balance; for if every individual in a nation
buys up, every one sells also, one his labour,
another his wares, a third his corn; and
if every thing grows dearer, except the article
you have to sell, you must own yourself completely
in the wrong: luckily the landed proprietors
are as little in the wrong as they possibly
can be; for as often as they renew a lease, they increase
their rental, just as if they had got possession
of my <i>little</i> secret, or as if there were <i>corporations</i>
also in agriculture.—The agents of industry are
still less liable to be in the wrong, for all their
operations are founded on the following rule:—<i>For
purchase so much,—for freight so much,—so
much for taxes,—to these add my commission or profit—The
balance is so much, which I must be paid, as
I shall settle with the members of my corporation.</i>
Besides, the commercial part of the nation is too
well persuaded how necessary it is to secure <i>a
favourable general balance</i>, to be mistaken in the
means of equipoising their private ones.</p>

<p>It is my opinion, therefore, that one may,
without being a conjurer, foretell that the last
dreadful and convulsive shock, almost generally
felt all over the world, will finally, and in a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
little time, end in the loose remembrance of
some thousands of hands having been, foolishly
enough, taken from their peaceable occupations,
very favourable to population, to employ them
in forwarding destructive plans, to which many
thousands of men have fallen a sacrifice; one
might also add, thousands of depredations, some
of which, the most pardonable in their nature,
have been punished at the gallows: perhaps even
they will say modestly in <i>France</i>, <i>We have reduced
the English, but we were four to one</i>—and then
<i>England</i> will proudly answer, <i>We have been reduced,
but we were only one to four</i>; nor would it
be at all unreasonable to lament, that the value of
4 or 5 millions sterling in gold and silver, fatuously
ornamented with the escutcheons of <i>England</i>
and <i>France</i>, <i>to consolidate for ever the interest of
140 or 150 millions, which constitute the last debts
contracted by the two rival nations</i>, be not humbly
stamped with the puncheon made use of to mark
the plate in <i>London</i> and <i>Paris</i> ... but, to
suppose that there will be in <i>London</i> or <i>Paris</i> a
single carriage less! that <i>France</i> will lessen her
importation of <i>English</i> goods, or that the demand
for <i>French</i> wines will be less from <i>England</i>—is
an idea which cannot, in my mind, coincide with
that of a population and industry which, hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
had sufficed in both nations to answer all those
different purposes; of a population, I say, and
of an industry, which will, in all likelihood, go
on still increasing every day, wherever they shall
not be checked by the laws.</p>

<p>One of the most fatal effects that spring from
that increase in the prices, occasioned by the
impost, is, as they say, the impossibility to
which a country is reduced, of supporting abroad
the rivalship, the competition of a nation less
burdened with taxes, who of course can, they
say, undersell every thing.</p>

<p>Such is, in fine, the question which I thought
the fastidious details I have entered into, ought
to preface, and might render of more easy
solution. But I request the reader to examine
previously,</p>

<p>1st, Whether an accession of wealth, an addition
of gold and money to the circulation, would
not increase the prices of every thing, as necessarily
as taxes must do it;—2dly, If that increase
in prices, procured by wealth, would not be accompanied
with the same inconveniences in regard
to the supporting of a competition abroad;—and,
3dly, If the stranger to whom we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
declare ourselves compelled to sell him our goods
dearer, <i>because we are grown richer than the
rival nation</i>, would not have the same answer to
give us, as if he were told, <i>that the cause of the
advance in the price is, our being loaded more heavily
with taxes</i>.</p>

<p>If these three questions cannot be answered but
in the affirmative, we should then be obliged to
suspect that there is something inexplicable, ill
judged, and not better grounded in the clamours
which resound in every part of <i>England</i> on this
subject; and this surmise might perhaps incline
the reader to peruse, without prejudice, what I
am going to set down, with no other view, than
to find out some useful truths.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading19"><i>On the Influence of the National Prices on the
Sales in Foreign Markets.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The impossibility of a competition in trade
with those who can afford cheaper, <i>in money</i>, the
articles which are to be the object of such a trade,
is so affirmatively maintained, and this principle
is so self-evident, when applied to two manufacturers
in the same town, circumscribed in their
selling as well as their buying, within the precincts
of the same country, where the one should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
always procure for 3, what the other would have
the stupidity to buy constantly at 4, that it becomes
pardonable (if one carries the examination
no farther) to admit of this idea, taken in a most
comprehensive manner, as one of those trivial
truths, which are not worth being searched into.
But I must own, that my reflexions on the pretended
necessity of keeping the commercial balance
constantly in <i>favour</i>, have made me rather
circumspect in giving credit to opinions the most
generally received.</p>

<p>It will not be in regard to the situation of a
country, which might allege a difference of 7 or
8 <i>per cent.</i> in its prices, as an insurmountable
bar to competition, that I shall examine in what
manner that very competition might be established;
I shall suppose a nation in the 6th, 7th,
and 8th <i>hypotheses</i>, wherein wheat is rated at
40<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter, by a series of revolutions in the
coin, or a multiplication of taxes, or by an increase
in wealth; and I shall place it in opposition
to another nation, considered as paying few
or no taxes, and humbly consuming her wheat
at the rate of 26 or 27<i>s.</i> the quarter.</p>

<p>In order to render the effects of the disproportion
more sensible, I shall further suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
that the shilling in both nations equally contains
86 grains of silver at the same standard.</p>

<p>Before these two nations be represented as
vying with each other in the foreign markets, I
shall, in the first instance, examine, whether it
might not be possible to settle between them a
direct trade, equally advantageous to both; for
if this be practicable, why should not the competition
be so likewise?—Is not the trade of
each competitor a direct one with the nation, in
which he vies?—And if, in this case, there be
a sure and equitable principle for one of the competitors,
why should it not be so for the other?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading20"><i>A necessary Principle of Trade, considered both as
<span class="upright">direct</span>, and <span class="upright">in Competition</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>In all imaginable suppositions, Commerce is nothing
more than the exchange of one want against
another want, or of one fancy against another fancy;
or, in fine, of a fancy against a want. All idea
of a commerce between two nations, as between
man and man, carries with it two objects different
in their nature, or their form; and the relative
value of these objects must essentially be
previously determined by some general principle,
if we mean not to transact business in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Now, the nation so rich, or, in other words,
so over-loaded with money, as to have raised, at
home, the quarter of wheat to 40<i>s.</i> can certainly
have no real interest in taking away the small
portion of the other, so scantily provided, that
she is obliged to sell for 24 or 27<i>s.</i> that which
fetches 40<i>s.</i> to the former; for, after all, what
would be the consequence of this spoliation? It
would serve only to lessen, in the opulent country,
the value of the precious metal already so
much disparaged there. What then will be the
case, if both have sense enough to prefer real enjoyments
to chimerical possessions, or rather,
profit to loss?</p>

<p>After the first years, destined, since the establishment
of Societies, to be spent in endeavouring,
if possible to cheat each other, it will certainly
become indispensable to agree upon a fixed rule of
appraisement, as unexceptionable for one country
as for the other. Now, in the supposed state of the
question, money cannot be that rule; for one of
them demands none, and the other is not willing
to part with any, not out of regard for the <i>favourable
balance</i>, but because she would get
less by the exportation of her money, than of
her goods; it will therefore become necessary,
for the respective advantage of the parties concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
to agree, that the labour of 10, of 100,
of 1000 men in one country, shall be looked
upon as repaid by the labour of the same number
of hands from the other, upon a tacit proviso
nevertheless, that the respective merchants in
both nations shall have it in their power to ransom
their countrymen, according to the proportions
established in both countries, <i>a little</i> by the
degree of estimation in which commerce is held,
but a <i>great deal</i> by the degree of foreign competition
by which the natives are or will be kept or
called to order.—And what is required to prevent
any injustice, and, above all, any mistrust from the
merchant of one nation towards the merchant of
the other?—Nothing more than to follow the
practice almost generally established all over <i>Europe</i>.—The
merchant in <i>Rome</i>, I suppose, will
send his son to his friend in <i>London</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
Now if the <i>Roman</i> perceives that in <i>London</i>,
where a quarter of wheat costs 40<i>s.</i> the article he
proposes to buy is commonly sold at 80<i>s.</i> he will
readily conceive, without having gone through a
course of algebra, that some other article, which
is bespoke of him in exchange, going for 54<i>s.</i> in
<i>Rome</i>, where wheat is at 27<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter, he will
exactly pay, value for value, according to the balance
and weight of the commercial sanctuary, the
80 of <i>London</i> with the 54 of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>It appears to me that matters thus settled,
might remain so for ever, without inconvenience,
without any alteration of prices, in either of the
two nations, had not Nature, either from mere
caprice, or to make men, in spite of themselves,
dependent on each other, and oblige them to
look on one another as brethren, established certain
unknown rules, in consequence of which,
that very same wheat, which would cost only 26
or 27<i>s.</i> at <i>Rome</i>, we have supposed, and 40<i>s.</i> in
<i>London</i>, this same wheat I say, the staff of life all
over <i>Europe</i>, every where accounted the standard
of labour, and every where cultivated in proportion
to its common necessity, is at times nevertheless
at one place in great plenty, and
very scarce at another. Now it seems to be a
matter of perfect indifference, that in regard to
any other article a merchant should ransom his
wealthy fellow citizen, a landed proprietor, by
charging him, for instance, 30 crowns for an
<i>English</i> trinket, originally purchased for no more
than 10, as an equitable measure between labour
and labour: it is the younger son who robs the
elder brother, to provide against the right of
primogeniture; or, in other words, it is no more
than the transferring of a few crowns, from a very
valuable hand, that of the consumer, to another
equally precious, that of an agent of the production:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
but it is of the utmost consequence for
the Sovereign, that, in a time of scarcity, insatiable
men, were they even his subjects, do not
presume to ask 4000 grains of silver for a quarter
of wheat, upon pretence that in <i>England</i>, from
whence it was imported, they have paid for it
3440 grains, (for it is always upon such <i>victorious
arguments</i> that the national monopolist endeavours
to defend his extortions, in times of distress);
the difference is so great between 4000
grains of silver, and only 2200 or 2300, the common
price by which that of labour is regulated
in my hypothesis, that all the treasure shut up
in the castle of <i>St. Angelo</i> could not prevent half
the inhabitants from starving for want of food in
a time of dearth. Luckily, however, this misfortune
may be obviated by one of the grandest
operations in finance, that can possibly be
conceived; for the object is no less than to
oblige the people to pay in good earnest for their
wheat in a moment of scarcity, at the rate of 4000
grains of silver <i>per</i> quarter, a price so far above
the means of that very people, to whom the intention
is to shew some favour. This financiering
operation is founded on the following remark,
obvious to the meanest capacity, and perhaps
not unworthy of being deeply searched into by
a judicious observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Were the wheat in <i>England</i> to cost only from
26 to 27<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter, the landed revenue, now
called 63 millions, would, in fact, amount to no
more than 42; this cannot be controverted:
in this case every thing would be paid for
in proportion, and certainly no one could gain
or lose by it: therefore if we invert the proportion,
<i>i. e.</i> if the quarter of wheat rise to
40<i>s.</i> at <i>Rome</i>, instead of 27<i>s.</i> and the other productions
of the earth and of industry rise in
price in the same proportion, as well as the labour
by which they are procured, the revenue of
the Ecclesiastical State, which, in the present
supposition, would be only 10 millions sterling,
would swell suddenly up to 15 millions, without
any one being a sufferer.—When the question is,
only to take a <i>nominal</i> share in the most dreaded
effects of the <i>English</i> taxes, in order to procure
such an addition of wealth, and get rid, at the
same time, of all fear of scarcity, it would
be very wrong to reject the expedient.—Money,
it is said, is wanted to carry on the
whole circulation at that rate;—but, in <i>England</i>,
where, by a single nod, they attract money
from every part of the globe, do they not make
guineas with paper?—Why should they not,
at <i>Rome</i>, make as many paper-crowns as are necessary
to facilitate a general circulation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
products there? These products are so wisely raised
in price from 27 to 40<i>s.</i> that the number of grains
of silver necessary to purchase a pound of wheat,
made into a loaf, being now nearly upon an
equality in <i>Holland</i>, in <i>France</i>, and at <i>Rome</i>,
the national trader, whose business it will be to
guard against scarcity, <i>and the foreign merchants
who will be invited to concur in remedying the evil</i>,
will no longer be able to add to the price of
wheat, any more than a reasonable compensation
for his advance, trouble, risque, and the quality
of the service rendered: a compensation besides,
on the extent of which it will be much more
difficult to impose upon the Sovereign, or any one
else, at least beyond a certain degree: to this advantage
let us add that of keeping the needy from
the thoughts of destroying that wealth which has
been gleaned by former services.</p>

<p>In regard to the confidence necessary to favour
that paper money, with the same degree of value
as that of <i>England</i> has obtained, I confess that I
do not hesitate to suppose, that the paper-money
of a Sovereign is never deemed contemptible,
but when an opinion prevails that he himself
will despise it; and I dare say (were I to be
charged with a want of modesty) that the public
is too deeply interested in the inferences that may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
be drawn from my arguments, for their consistency
or absurdity not to be very soon demonstrated:
now, supposing them to be consistent, I think
it would be, <i>then</i>, beyond all possibility, even
to imagine a circumstance wherein the interest
of a Prince could induce him to dishonour
himself. This great truth, generally acknowledged,
could not long remain ineffectual.—But
this is not the matter in point.</p>

<p>The case in point is, to observe,</p>

<p>First, that, in the same manner as foreign coin
is resolved into the quantity and standard of the
metals that compose it, in order to know how
much of the national coin may be given in exchange,
just so all kinds of foreign commodities are
resolved into the quantity of labour contained in
them, or supposed to be so, that the quantity of
national labour, corresponding thereto, may be
ascertained:</p>

<p>Secondly, that therefore, labour alone being
the standard of value, <i>labour</i> is consequently the
only <i>standard</i> that can regulate the exchanges
between one nation and another:</p>

<p>Thirdly, that the national prices, or, to speak
more properly, money is, in fact, the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
proper standard of labour between two manufacturers
in the same town; and that nothing
but the misconduct and unrestrained cupidity of
the one, can prevent him from selling his goods
at the price by which the other clears a profit
that satisfies him; but in each country the common
price of labour being arbitrarily determined
by the common price of the materials necessary
to set the labourer at work, the common
price of wheat is, in fact, the measure of the
common price of labour in all nations:</p>

<p>Fourthly, that it is impossible a nation should
be willing to barter a greater quantity of its own
labour, against a less quantity of the labour of
another; <i>and yet it is to such a degree of absurdity,
that we must reduce the supposed <span class="upright">advantage</span></i>
of the <i>dreaded</i> competition:</p>

<p>Fifthly, that the liberty of exporting corn,
even under its present restrictions, makes, as it
were, of all <i>Europe</i>, at this day, <i>only</i> one family;
that, on the whole, there is constantly as much of
that indispensable commodity as is necessary for
all the family; but that a man whose folly would
be to trace out, describe, and acknowledge,
throughout every thing that concerns society in
any essential point, the stamp of an universal benevolence,
determined to unite all men together
by their wants and interests if it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
do it by more disinterested motives, would not
prove too inconsistent in a fit of that folly which
might induce him to suspect some marks of that
stamp, even in the bad seasons, in the storms
which successively visit all the parts of the world,
make them all sensible of the necessity of such
union, and soon bring nearly upon a level,
all the different prices of that indispensable commodity,
the cultivation of which requires, almost
every where, the same labour, or which,
by its quantity, always answers, upon an average,
to the labour bestowed upon it:</p>

<p>Sixthly and in fine, that hence results the impossibility
that there should long subsist, in the
prices of any thing, a difference capable of
making any competition whatever, formidable
<i>to any man who will not be so unjust as to wish and
ask beads of gold for beads of glass, or, in other
words, to try in bartering, to obtain the labour
of 150 in exchange for that of 100 only</i>.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, nevertheless, that there should
exist at this day, a nation pretending to be formidable
in her competition, and who should
only be, in fact, remarkable for her folly, that
is to say, a nation so very blind, as to endeavour
to keep the price of her wheat under that of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
other countries; I agree that the labour of her artisans
would be rated in consequence, and that the
produce of her industry might thus be purchased
at a lower rate than that of any other nation:—but
what advantage could she derive from thence
in a competition abroad?⸺Though she should
denominate at home the sum of her exports,
only <i>one million</i> for instance, because she would
call 100, the quantity of wheat, which elsewhere
would be called 150, how could she require less
for her returns than the other countries, who,
by the price of their wheat, would be compelled
to call 1,500,000 that which she herself would
call 1,000,000?—Would not this million represent,
as really, the labour of 75,000 of her
workmen (their families included), as if it were
by her denominated 1,500,000<i>l.</i>?—Besides, the
place where she has carried her goods is not the
end of her voyage; and it is so much more
necessary for her to obtain in return the produce
of 75,000 labourers (families included),
adequate to what she herself has given, as being
obliged to carry those returns home, where every
thing sells, in the <i>hypothesis</i>, 50 <i>per cent.</i>
below the price they would fetch any where
else, she would lose in lowering the rates of
her exports, all the fruit she might expect to
reap from her voyage.—This is what escapes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
observation. They see nothing but money in
commercial operations, instead of observing that
all the nations in <i>Europe</i>, neither do nor can
require, and that <i>England</i> herself does not preserve
more of it than <i>the sum necessary to answer those
five articles</i> of which I have spoken in examining
her balance: I shall in the sequel bring
some proofs, in addition to those I have already
given; but I think I have said enough
here, to justify me in <i>insisting</i>, that the competition
can be dreaded by the unjust man alone,
by that man who wishes to sell the labour of 100
workmen as if it were the labour of 150, and by
that man, not less unreasonable, who, compelled
to sell his own goods 10 <i>per cent.</i> dearer, should
refuse to pay also 10 <i>per cent.</i> dearer for the foreign
goods which he would ask in exchange.—If
that principle—a principle of the strictest justice,
is still unknown in <i>Europe</i>; as an <i>American</i>, I
glory that it is not so in <i>America</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading21"><i>Reflexions on a Letter from <span class="upright">Philadelphia</span>, inserted
in the <span class="upright">English</span> News-papers.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>A Merchant of <i>Philadelphia</i> offers to his former
<i>Jamaica</i> correspondents, (see <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
and <i>London Advertiser</i> of June 24, 1785)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
to serve them, with all such articles as they may
require, at the current price of <i>Philadelphia</i>,
only with the addition of freight and the usual
commission. In order to render his proposal
unequivocal, he mentions staves, and makes
a calculation, by which it appears that he could
not land them in <i>Jamaica</i> for less than 12<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i>
1½<i>d.</i> currency per thousand; he then adds:</p>

<p>“By this calculation it appears, that staves
would come considerably higher than they
used to be in <i>Jamaica</i> before the war: it is
true they are so, but it is owing to their being
risen at <i>Philadelphia</i> nearly 100 <i>per cent.</i> Of
<i>course</i>, <i>Jamaica</i> prices must be in proportion;
<i>for it would be unreasonable</i> to expect goods of
<i>Jamaica</i> at the old prices, when those of <i>America</i>
have advanced so considerably.”</p>

<p>I shall venture upon some remarks on the
foregoing proposition.</p>

<p>First, The <i>Philadelphian</i> has sense enough to
feel, that the war must advance the price of goods
from the Colonies, in a due proportion to the general
increase in prices of all that is carried there.
In <i>Europe</i>, on the contrary, people are not only
strangers to the idea of that universal chain, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
they are so convinced, or rather so persuaded, that
<i>the Colonies were created, and do actually exist, for
the sole pleasure and interest of their respective metropolises</i>,
that no imaginable means are spared to
lessen the price of their products in the mother
country who receives them, in order that <i>this
tender mother</i> may sell them at a cheaper rate in
the foreign markets; but, ye mother countries!
your colonists are also your children, foreigners are
only your brethren.—It must be owned, however,
that the coffee, indigo, and cottons, of
<i>Jamaica</i>, <i>Grenada</i>, <i>Guadaloupe</i>, <i>St. Domingo</i>, &amp;c.
are no more the <i>territorial commodities</i> of <i>England</i>,
and of <i>France</i>, than the corn and other
productions of those two kingdoms; and that
the arguments adduced in regard to the colonies,
are, as <i>Montaigne</i> says, <i>of a piece</i> with that by
which they prove, that, <span class="smcap">the cheaper the
corn, the more brilliant is the commercial
competition</span>.—<i>Were not Nature by her underhand
work constantly fighting, with some advantage,
against the dreams of speculators, to what
pitch of misery would not agriculture be reduced in
all parts of the world!</i></p>

<p>Secondly, War has been productive, in the
United States of <i>America</i>, of the same effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
which attend it every where else, viz. an augmentation
in the price of every thing.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The increase of nearly <i>cent. per cent.</i>
assigned to the staves, does not determine the
general advance of <i>American</i> goods; the excessive,
but instantaneous price of one article
only, denotes an extraordinary demand for that
object, and the actual impossibility of answering
that demand; the level, so necessary in all prices,
naturally returns as soon as the medium of the demand
is known, and has determined the number
of hands necessary to supply it: now it cannot
be doubted, but that the goods in <i>America</i>
must have advanced in price, much more than
any where else, because the expences of the Colonies
have been, during the war, relatively
speaking, much more considerable than any
where else, considering the discredit inseparable
from the precariousness of their situation. But
the difference between their inland <i>common</i> prices,
and those of <i>Europe</i>, was so great (this will presently
be seen), that they may increase them
enough to pay off the interest of their national
debt, and yet keep the <i>European</i> prices at a
distance.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The United States are now a foreign
nation in regard to <i>Jamaica</i>, which belongs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
to <i>England</i>; yet this consideration does
not render them so far unjust, as to shake off the
burden of their taxes, and fix it on the inhabitants
of <i>Jamaica</i>; they only make them nominal
partners in that burden, (if the expression may
be allowed), without any inconvenience arising
therefrom to either of the parties.</p>

<p>Fifthly, They have the true notion of an equitable
trade, founded on the continuation of former
relations between goods and goods; a principle
from which I only draw inferences relative
to the national debt, and which suffices to destroy
all the <i>hideousness</i> of that phantom.</p>

<p>Sixthly, They do not pretend, with the <i>Europeans</i>,
that the increase in the national prices,
can in any thing affect their exportation; but
they have found, that being obliged to sell
dearer, it was their duty to offer very frankly
to pay also dearer for whatever they wanted in
return.</p>

<p>Seventhly, They do not entertain the least
doubt on what <i>seems</i> to be unknown in <i>Europe</i>,
namely, that the real benefit of a voyage can be
found only in the price which the returns will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
meet with, when arrived in the country where
the voyage is to terminate.</p>

<p>Eighthly, In the union, and in the execution
of these different points, centers the little
mystery, by means of which Nature has hitherto
filled up by slow degrees, and by which the
<i>American</i> proposes, without thinking so to do,
to fill up with more dispatch, those little <i>furrows</i>
of taxes, the very name of which is now a bugbear,
but would cease to be so, if the manner in
which they are planned, imposed, and above all,
collected, did not prolong and increase the real
and momentary evil, which will ever be inseparable
from them.</p>

<p>Ninthly, It is singular enough, that the <i>European</i>
cultivator should be taught by the <i>American</i>
trader, <i>the necessity and the justice</i> of an increase
of price in the <i>productions</i> of the earth, <i>proportionable</i>,
says the honest <i>Philadelphian</i>, <i>to that
which is to be met with in the price of the productions
of industry</i>:—<i>It would be unreasonable</i>, says
he, <i>to expect the goods of <span class="upright">Jamaica</span> at the old prices,
when those of <span class="upright">Philadelphia</span> have advanced so considerably</i>.—Nay,
say the <i>European</i> manufacturers,
since our goods, by means of the taxes, have increased
10 <i>per cent.</i> it follows necessarily that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
price of wheat, sugar, indigo, &amp;c. should fall
in the same proportion, in order <i>that the trade
in competition may be supported abroad;—had not
Nature, by her underhand work, constantly fought
with some advantage against the dreams of speculators,
and against the much more dreadful surreptions
of cupidity, to what pitch of misery would not
agriculture be reduced in all parts of the world!</i></p>

<p>The following estimates may be of some service;
their utility is independent of the absolute
precision of the facts on which they are founded;
one may, as occasion requires, extend or contract
the compasses.</p>

<p>Previous to the last war the common price of
wheat was, upon an average, in <i>America</i> about
20<i>s.</i> sterling <i>per</i> quarter, (vide Mr. <i>A. Young’s
Political Arithmetic</i>).</p>

<p>If in <i>England</i> a population of 9,000,000 of
industrious inhabitants, yields a landed revenue
of 60,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling, the wheat being there
at 40<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter, a population of 3,000,000
of industrious inhabitants in <i>America</i>, where
wheat sells at 20<i>s.</i> a quarter, ought to produce
<i>at least</i> a landed revenue of 10,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling;
I say <i>at least</i>, first, because the land is new, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
produces as much, with less culture; and secondly,
because that part of the inhabitants employed
in agriculture in <i>England</i>, constitute only
one third of the whole population, and that
in all probability, above two thirds of the
<i>Americans</i> are employed in works of husbandry.
It may therefore be presumed, that their
landed revenue exceeds 20,000,000, instead of
the 10 which I have set down; but this surplus
of 10,000,000, only serves to make good
both the national and foreign industry, which
is to balance it, and pay off the taxes: so
that, in whatever light my <i>thesis</i> be considered,
every error turns to their advantage.</p>

<p>In limiting their landed revenue to 10,000,000,
their wheat remaining at 20<i>s.</i> <i>per</i> quarter; let
everyone judge what load of taxes they could bear,
before the price of their wheat and other territorial
productions, should come up to that of
the same commodities of <i>Europe</i>, even including
the expences for the export of their surplusage.</p>

<p>Let every one judge also of the necessity of
their bankruptcy, the idea of which has been so
fondly cherished by some low-minded people,
and the narrative of which, they feared perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
themselves, would unavoidably stain the first
pages of the history of their political existence.</p>

<p>The last war, it is said, has loaded them with
an interest of 1,000,000 <i>per annum</i>. Would a
tax of 10 <i>per cent.</i> on every article, or rather on
the total of the produce of national, as well as
foreign industry, <i>consumed within the country</i>,
be productive of any other effect, but that of
increasing the prices nearly as much? and would
the cultivators of wheat and other productions
of the earth, have occasion for any other expedient
to pay the tax, <i>without being at any expence,
without any one being aggrieved, (provided they
should raise in the same proportion the price of labour
attending cultivation)</i> but that of advancing,
in the mean time, the price of their wheat, and
other productions of the earth, from 10 to 11 or
12, from 20 to 22 or 24?—This is the case in my
first <i>hypothesis</i>, with this difference, that the
21,000,000 interest, mentioned therein, represented
highways, havens, canals, public schools,
&amp;c. and that the interest of 1,000,000, in the
United States, will represent the establishment
of their independence. Such a monument is,
in my opinion, too precious to admit a thought
of destroying it by a reimbursement,—<i>a reimbursement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
palpably useless so soon as the price of
every thing is restored to a level with the interest
of any national loan whatever</i>.</p>

<p>They have committed some errors; more
will follow: they know not what to fix upon;
nor will they know for some time, perhaps for
a long time.—Is there a State in <i>Europe</i> that
can reproach them with any false step, of which
that very same State did not set the precedent
at some period of its history?⸺But with their
principle concerning exportation, a principle
founded on justice and evidence, they have already
perceived that the necessitated price of 22
or 24, instead of 20, must be felt in their
country alone; and if their commodities exported
for the purpose of procuring such articles
for their home consumption, as they stand in
need of, continue still to yield them the same
quantity of those articles of consumption, as were
obtained before the war, will they not perceive
that the home prices, which the re-action of the
taxes shall have set upon the whole of their productions,
establish in the country an exact balance
of those new prices at which the taxes will oblige
them to sell the articles to be imported?</p>

<p>Compelled by necessity to have recourse to
paper-money, will it be long before they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
made sensible, that nothing more than internal
credit is wanted to make this paper equal to
coin, and answer all its purposes for ever, if they
should be thus wisely inclined,—if this measure
should be found the only means of curbing
effectually the cupidity of those with whom they
shall have occasion to trade?</p>

<p>Will it be long before they perceive, that
this credit will follow close upon the solidity of
public engagements,—a solidity demonstrated
by the evidence of the inutility of a base and
infamous robbery?</p>

<p>Will it be long before they feel that all the
actual wealth of a State, its real wealth, is nothing
more or less than the mass of its present
industry; that all its <i>possible</i> wealth can arise only
from the sum of all its <i>possible</i> labour; that the
greatest riches are only the greatest sum of labour?
that if this labour is a bitter pill, the gold and
silver in which it is wrapped up, are only (like
honours, titles, dignities, fame, esteem, &amp;c.) different
kinds of powders, which sweeten the taste
of it to those who are ignorant of its value, to
those who know not how necessary labour is to
support every day, without being weary, and
sometimes without regret, the wretched burthen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of our lives; and in fine, that paper, <i>once got into
credit</i>, can, in this respect, be an ample substitute
for gold and silver ... but how many circumstances,
where gold and silver cannot supply
the want of credit?</p>

<p>Will it be long before they become sensible,
that they are clogged in no part of their legislation,
by those preposterous maxims which can
be justified only by the circumstances that gave
them birth, by those tyrannical regulations
which owed their success wholely to the ignorance
of their cotemporaries, by that chaos of
contradictory regulations, all of which became
perhaps necessary by degrees, after the first was
extorted by cupidity?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading22"><i>Under what Point of View Premiums and other
Encouragements of Exportation may be considered.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The principles of the <i>Americans</i> concerning
exportation, lead us to the examination of the
doctrine of premiums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>If the want of objects, capable of exercising
advantageously the industry of a numerous
and active people, should compel government,
<i>on account of some difficulties unconquerable
by art and nature</i>, to apply that industry
to some other object, on which it would be impossible
to support abroad the competition of
another nation, that is, to offer equally with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
latter an even quantity of labour of one sort, for
an even quantity of labour of a different one,
there is no doubt but, in such a case, a certain
premium, to maintain the competition with the
country most partially favoured by art and nature,
would prove, of all institutions, the most
judicious and the most humane; it would be a
kind of indirect tax in favour of laborious indigence;
a tax, much more eligible than many
others, which, though destined to the relief of
wretchedness, often increase it, by checking the
efforts of industry, by even providing a resource
for idleness, and sometimes an alluring, a comfortable
prospect for debauchery.</p>

<p>It was represented to a Prince truly worthy
of the throne he fills, that a manufactory, in
which 8 or 900 persons were constantly employed,
stood him in 4 or 5,000 crowns more
than it produced. <i>How!</i> (replied the Sovereign)
<i>does it cost me no more than 4 or 5,000 crowns
to feed a thousand beggars, and keep them constantly
at work? It is a cheap bargain indeed!</i> The most
subtle of all ministers of state could make no other
reply to such an answer, than to propose some
means, equally effectual, and calculated to
attain, at a cheaper rate, the two most important
ends that a prince can have in view,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
<i>destroying beggary, and</i>, in a manner, <i>creating
labour</i>.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, some other circumstances,
which may also justify premiums on exportation;
for instance, the wheat intended for exportation,
is an indispensable article amongst the
necessaries of life: it constitutes one third, sometimes
the half of a nation’s riches; it is <i>essential</i>
that it be not in such quantity as to fall in
price, because the disparagement of its value
would discourage the cultivator; yet it is advantageous
that there should be, upon a medium,
a little more than is wanted, in order to keep it
at the medium price it ought to fetch, that <i>one
may have it in his power to purchase that which
another wants to sell</i>. The first thing therefore
to be examined is, whether the medium price,
at which it must be kept, in order to equipoise
the quantity of national industry which it must
represent, be not so considerable,</p>

<p>First, By reason of some prohibitory act, forbidding
the exportation of other productions of
the earth, which, by this means, become cheaper
than they were before this act took place, oblige
the cultivator to advance his price in the others,
that the whole may be raised to the level of industry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, By reason of some other premiums
on exportation, granted to various branches of
the national industry, which, on that very account,
are grown not only much dearer within
the nation, but have also enhanced the price of
all other corresponding commodities, by withdrawing
from them, hands which would have increased
their quantity:</p>

<p>Thirdly, In consequence of some prohibitions
or restrictions equivalent thereto, which afford
to the national manufacturer the means of selling
his goods 10 <i>per cent.</i> dearer than he could
do, if such reasonable duties were laid upon foreign
industry, as would leave national industry
in possession of the advantages, which she has a
right to, and deprive her only of the iniquitous
privilege of ransoming those by whom she is fostered:</p>

<p>Fourthly, By the effect of those bodies corporate,
(<i>corporations</i>) which, if justly appreciated,
are but so many private conspiracies against
the public, whom they strip of the benefit of
<i>national</i> competition, after having wrested from
them the advantages of <i>foreign</i> competition, which
would soon have been followed by the former,
<i>infinitely more important than the other</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>If the result of the proposed enquiry should
show, that one of these four causes, or rather all
of them together, have entirely perverted the natural
price of every article in the nation, it seems
to me that it would be worth the attention of the
legislature to examine also, whether the repeal
of all premiums, prohibitions, restrictions, and
other devices of the various passions of the human
heart, either to clash against each other,
or to balance their respective injustice, would not
prove adequate to the only aim which we may
reasonably wish to attain, I mean that of <i>keeping,
at the least expence, a just equilibrium between
national agriculture and industry, by securing to
both, at the least expence, all the advantages which
they have a right to expect from the agriculture
and industry of other nations</i>.</p>

<p>But if indeed we were fettered by the errors
of past centuries, it would then be necessary
to grant, <i>in the fullest extent</i>, the wished-for
premium on the most important article; do
nothing more for the present, but refuse new
ones to all the rest; watch attentively the favourable
minute for the restoration of natural
order, and forward it, perhaps, by convincing
every one, that the most necessary of all premiums
would have proved useless, had it not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
been preceded by prohibitions, restrictions, corporations,
&amp;c. <i>the end of which is as manifestly
unjust, as their effects are injurious to all but those
who sue for them</i>; and that, in fine, a premium
granted under a circumstance the most likely to
justify such a measure, is not, as several people
have hitherto imagined, a necessary means of
maintaining elsewhere a foreign competition, but
a very inadequate compensation for that foreign
competition of which we are deprived in so
many respects.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading23"><i>On the Influence of the various Kinds of Taxation
upon National Prices.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>If I mistake not, I have proved that it is indifferent
to agriculture and industry, whether
the prices rise or fall, provided it be always
in a due and reciprocal proportion. Nor
is it less indifferent, whether the increase
proceeds from taxes, from monopoly, or from
accession of wealth, and whether the decrease be
brought about by the extirpation of monopoly,
or by the triumph of smuggling; so long as the
prices balance each other, no one can be injured
however loud people may be in their clamours;
it is impossible to shut one’s eyes against the
evidence of such a point. Why then should we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
deny the consequence which naturally follows,
of the harmlessness of taxes in themselves, the
impossibility of their producing in any one’s
situation, any thing beyond a momentary sensation,
<i>when they are laid with discernment</i>; and
the futility of either fears or hopes entertained
of their ending at last in a national bankruptcy?</p>

<p>Yet, “to enjoy, is to obey,” says Pope:—To
make the best use we can of the creation, is the
thanksgiving the most worthy of the Creator.—There
is not a man therefore who ought not
to repine at seeing the general rate of prices
increase in vain, since this very rise compels
us to lavish, in coin, a considerable quantity
of those two precious metals, gold and silver,
which would prove more agreeable, if turned
into plate, or even into small pocket-statues,
designed for the private worship of those who
would blush only in public, for this kind of
idolatry. I should like therefore to examine,
in regard to prices, what is <i>natural</i>, what <i>necessary</i>,
and what <i>forced</i>; in order to find out
what might be saved, if people would attend
only to the necessary average.</p>

<p>In the first period of Societies, when they knew
of no other want in the State but personal service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
when it was necessary and possible, the
common price of the articles then in circulation,
was determined by the quantity of coin <i>then</i>
existing in the nation: this is what may be justly
termed the <i>natural price</i>. At this present time,
when money is substituted to personal service,
and supplies so advantageously its place; when
each representation of an extra service leaves on
every article, the stamp of a seal, which, without
adding to the real or relative value of <i>any thing</i>,
increases nevertheless the nominal value of
<i>every thing</i>;—at this present time, when every
nation has all the industry necessary to procure
the coin wanted for this over-charge, <i>it
is the price, which this very over-charge sets upon
the different objects, that regulates and attracts
the quantity of silver to correspond therewith</i>; and
this price, which may be called <i>necessary</i>, is often
evidently <i>forced</i>: I say, <i>evidently</i>, because, in
the state of general correspondence, or, if you
will, of that happy dependence wherein all the
States of <i>Europe</i> stand reciprocally towards each
other at this hour, when we see in one country
the same objects, of the same quality, wrought
with equal skill, 15 <i>per cent.</i> dearer than any
where else, who can doubt but a part of that
difference, of that extraordinary price, proceeds
from taxes, and the other from monopoly?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
But what part belongs to this, what part to
the other? This is not so easily found out;
1st, because the part which is the work of monopoly,
solely depends on the moderation of the
monopolist, who never fails pleading the taxes for
excuse; and, 2dly, because that part, which proceeds
from the taxes, depends not only on the
tax itself, but also on the manner of laying it, and
on the effect which it is likely to produce in the
minds of the people who are to support it.
Such a tax as will make a slow, and only a trifling
sensation in the prices of the <i>French</i> markets,
will occasion all at once a considerable one in
those of <i>England</i>: I shall hereafter state my reasons
for this conjecture.</p>

<p>I am as little qualified to investigate all these
different questions, as those which I have ventured
hitherto to touch upon; I shall persevere,
nevertheless, with that freedom which I derive
from the purity of my intentions, and with that
diffidence which must follow the consciousness of
a capacity so unequal to the task.—I shall first
of all adapt to <i>England</i>, and then to <i>France</i>, the
reflexions suggested to me by some hundreds of
suppositions, which had engrossed my time before
I had perused <i>Young’s Political Arithmetic</i>,
and the work of Mr. <i>Necker</i>, which has but lately
fallen into my hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading24"><i>On the Object of all Ministers of Finance in laying
Taxes.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>In this indulgent age, wherein nothing more is
required on any one subject, than a little decency,
it would be a ridiculous and fruitless hypocrisy
to propose a tax, as the means of encouraging
virtue, or of discountenancing vice; it
is not, at least in a country where a man convicted
of smuggling wool, is by law sentenced
to have his hand cut off, nor in another where a
smuggler of salt is condemned for years to serve
on board the gallies, that one should preach up
the heart-felt concern he must experience at
framing a law which would make it felony to
drink spirituous liquors if he had really a mind
to prevent intoxication; it is hoped on the contrary,
nay, firmly believed, that the sweetness of
the poison will make palatable the very bitterness
of the tax, and its absurd disproportion to the real
value of the taxed article: besides, it is too evident,
that it is not the difference of a few pence
<i>more</i> that will prevent a man from drinking to
excess when he is so inclined, nor a few pence
<i>less</i> that will occasion another to inebriate himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
when his only motive for drinking is a
moderate pleasure, or the necessity of allaying his
thirst. The object of every Minister, in laying a
tax, is always to procure the sum at which he
has rated its produce; if the tax should answer
any other purpose, this additional one is considered
merely with regard to the prospect it
affords of making good another tax less productive
than was at first expected. In fact,
a minister of finance is not a <i>præfectus morum</i>—a
moral censor: the State is in want of a certain
sum; <i>that’s enough, it must be found</i>.—Let
us then examine, what kind of taxation will
be the least burdensome in its operation, give its
first shock with the least violence, and be attended
with inconveniences of the shortest duration.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading25"><i>Effects of a general Poll-Tax.</i></h2>

</div>

<h3><i>Eleventh Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>In the year 1779, the taxes in <i>England</i> amounted,
I shall say, to 10 millions; I shall suppose
too, that this was the tenth part of the general
produce of the land and industry: therefore the
10th part of the nominal value of that <i>general produce</i>
belonged to the tax, or was <i>necessitated by the
tax</i>; the 40 shillings, which, to facilitate my operations,
I shall also suppose to be the average<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
price of the quarter of wheat, must then have
been considered as the <i>necessary</i> price, or the price
<i>necessitated</i> by the tax, and 36<i>s.</i> as the <i>natural</i>
price, or the price <i>acquired</i> by the sole, <i>natural</i> increase
of the national wealth. But in order that
those 36<i>s.</i> might be called the <i>natural</i> price, the
taxes should have been divided in such a manner
as to load each particular article with a 9th
part of its value; that is to say, that each individual,
possessed of a property denominated 9,
should see it charged only with one ninth more,
in consequence of a general poll-tax, which we
shall suppose to have been assessed <i>with the utmost
impartiality</i>. In effect, it appears, that in this
case the proprietor of a quarter of wheat, who, in
consequence of the tax, would have raised the
wheat from 36 to 40<i>s.</i> could not be said to have
injured the hatter, who would sell him for 40
guineas the 40 hats which, previously to the poll-tax,
he used to let him have for 36 guineas. It
also appears, that the hatter could not be injured
by giving 10 to the workman, instead of the
9 which he had hitherto paid; and that, in fine,
<i>if 27 millions had proved sufficient for circulation
formerly, three millions more, once found, were fully
adequate to the annual and perpetual payment of
those 10 millions of taxes</i>, without any one being
a sufferer, but at the instant of the first payment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
This system is deficient only in point of practicability;
it is not established in <i>England</i>: 36
shillings therefore are not the <i>natural</i> price of
wheat; the wheat certainly owes above 4 shillings
to the taxes, if its current price amounts
to 40<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Let it be observed, nevertheless, that if the
system of a poll-tax could be reduced to practice,
if it were not of all systems the most absurd,
though the easiest for government, if it were not of
all systems that in which it is most evidently
impossible to avoid thousands of injuries to the
subject, one might establish now in <i>England</i> a
new tax of 10 millions annually, and pay it for
ever, without altering in the least the condition
of anybody, <i>provided one could find previously, and
once for all, 2,600,000l. and that wheat should
advance in price from 40s. to 43s. 4d. <span class="smcap">and every
thing else in proportion</span></i>. This appears to
me so glaringly evident, that it extorts from
me the affirmative tone. Now as soon as this
should be effected, <span class="smcap">the burden of the tax
would clearly be NULL</span>.</p>

<p>But, it will be objected, the price of wheat is
not thus arbitrarily advanced:—certainly not;
for were this to be the case, it might also be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
lowered at pleasure, and would <i>every other day</i>,
alternately rise from 1 to 80<i>s.</i> and fall from 80
to 1, since for this operation (become indispensable)
it would suffice that there should be in all
the provinces of <i>England</i> as many bodies-corporate
(<i>corporations</i>) in <i>agriculture</i>, as there are in
<i>industry</i>. I am even inclined to think, that it
would then be minutely examined, <i>Whether it be
in fact advantageous to agriculture, that the merchants
export more goods than they import?</i> (a due
attention being paid to the five articles so often
mentioned, which render necessary the importation
of bullion); a question of the utmost importance,
to which I do not see that any body
has hitherto attended, and which might be so
easily determined, if my principles are just.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading26"><i>Effects of a Land-Tax.</i></h2>

</div>

<p><i>All taxes, it is said, fall on the land at last.
Land is the true, the only spring of wealth; wealth
should be taxed at its very source.</i></p>

<p>It is certain, that merely by knowing how
the matter stands, we know how to proceed accordingly;
and that, in the long-run, every thing
arranges itself in the least exceptionable manner
that the system of taxation will permit. The
following is probably the course which things
would take, in the system of a land-tax, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
were necessary now to lay on the land a new
tax of 10 millions annually, supposing always the
landed revenue at 60 millions, and the quarter
of wheat at 40 shillings.</p>

<h3><i>Twelfth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p><i>(I must premise, that in all I have now to say, not
only on the present hypothesis, but on all those that
follow, I build on this principle; <span class="upright">that, from the
moment every individual pays the tax</span>, nobody
pays it; <span class="upright">that nevertheless its produce reverts to
the creditors of the State, and that therefore
every body is interested in carrying matters
to that issue as soon as possible</span>.—If there never
existed in the average of prices any revolution
so sudden, so great, and constant in its effect, as
the one which I am about to suppose; it is because
it never was necessary to lay all at once 10
millions of taxes. The effect produced by one million
on a revenue like that which <span class="upright">England</span> enjoys, is
so trifling, so gradual, that it never can be felt.—But
to my hypothesis).</i></p>

<p>The march of industry is always firm; she can
never be bewildered by her guide. A tax of 2
shillings upon a hat will soon occasion either an
alteration in the quality, or a proportionate increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
in its price<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. <i>Nothing more just.</i> But agriculture
has only one resource; she cannot alter the
quality of her productions, and she is always
timid when she wants to increase their prices.
Let it be granted, however, that the first attempt
of the cultivator will be to enhance boldly the
price of his goods, in a proportion which may
return him the amount of the tax supposed to be
of 10 millions: his wheat, of course, will rise
from 40 to 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and so with regard to other productions;
then his revenue, instead of 60, will be
70 millions; but, being obliged to lay down 10
for the tax, he will have only 60 millions left.</p>

<p>Let us now observe, that when the operations
of agriculture are talked of in consequence of
taxes, the land proprietor is alluded to; and
from him they suppose that the ten millions
are taken, just as the fleece is shorn from
the sheep; but, on the other hand, that proprietor,
though not very clear in his idea of what
is best for him to do, feels mechanically that he
has a right to defend his fleece, that is, to increase
the price of the productions of his land, because
without them, neither the manufacturer nor the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Minister of Finance can subsist, and to raise that
price to such a level as will subject him to pay only
just as much as the minister and the manufacturer:
and <i>this again appears to me extremely just</i>.</p>

<p>Now this very proprietor receives of his 60
millions revenue, or rather of the revenue of his
land, no more than about 20 millions; (this is
nearly the result of Mr. <i>Young</i>’s statement: it
will be seen, in the sequel, that more or less
would only alter the proportion of the shares,
without having the least influence either on the application
of the principle, or on its consequences):
the 40 millions overplus is swallowed up, <i>viz.</i>
for the daily pay of the labourer, 20 millions, and
20 millions for the other charges with which the
estates are encumbered, tythes, profits of farmers,
&amp;c. &amp;c. It follows, of course,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Either</i></p>

<p>That the proprietor’s share must be advanced
to 30 millions, if he alone be taxed; and this
will leave each of the other parts interested in the
landed revenue, in possession of its 20 millions,
as well after as before the tax;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>That each of the three parts taxed singly, at
3,333,333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and enabled to pay the impost
by an advance of price, both in the productions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and in the wages of labour, be reduced to its
primitive 20 millions, after the payment of the
tax.</p>

<p>One is evidently equal to the other; but what
is not so, is, that <i>industry</i>, who paid her workmen
with 20 millions when the quarter of wheat was
at 40<i>s.</i> cannot pay them since the wheat is increased
to 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> but by adding to the former
wages, 3,333,333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> an advance which,
when divided on the total of her products,
heretofore rated at 60 millions, raises each third
part of 20 to 21,111,111, and some trifling fractions.—Now,
there remains in the hands of
each of the parties concerned in agriculture,
only 20 millions over and above the payment
of the tax.—Those who are in the persuasion
that the discharge of the import must lessen, by
its whole amount at least, the revenue of those
who pay it, think, no doubt, that agriculture is
very well off, to have, by raising the price of its
commodities two thirds, lightened the weight
of so terrible a burden; yet if it were possible
by a vigorous exertion, by an additional increase
in the price of provisions, to make it null to
every body, I do not see that it would be reasonable
to oppose such exertion; for, after all,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Either</i></p>

<p>The first increase, brought on by <i>agriculture</i>,
was unjust; the proprietor was doomed to sustain
alone the whole weight of the tax, if we allow
<i>the taxator</i>, the man who laid the tax, to have
had a single thought on the subject:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>The further advance in the prices of agriculture
is of the most indispensable necessity, if the
<i>taxator</i> has only thought of getting the amount of
the tax with the least trouble to himself, leaving
to Nature the care of distributing <i>to every one</i>
complete justice,—to Nature, who never fails to
do it, and who, in so complicated an operation,
employs only the simple spring of that private cupidity,
with which she has armed and shielded
every individual; just as, in order to settle the
most exact symmetry in that admirable edifice
commonly called a hive, she employs no other
agent than the reciprocal <i>pressure</i> of that multitude
of architects who work at it, each of whom
thinks of nothing but to secure a little cell for
himself.</p>

<h3><i>Thirteenth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>Let us then suppose that agriculture, judiciously
determined by wisdom not to suffer the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
least encroachments on any part of her <i>cell</i>, or
mechanically led by cupidity to justice, boldly
raises the price of her wheat from 40 to 50<i>s.</i> and
the rest of her products in a due proportion;
her general revenues will then be increased from
60 to 75 millions; each of the three parts interested
therein will therefore stand at 25 millions,
but will be reduced to 21,666,666<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> when the tax is paid off;—</p>

<p>Industry, compelled also by the advanced
prices of the productions of the earth, to pay
her workmen 25 instead of the 20 millions which
they required in the first instance, will divide the
additional 5 millions amongst the 60 millions
of her former returns; each third share therefore,
rated hitherto at 20 millions, will, by means of
the addition, rise to 21,666,666<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>—<i>which
is the exact balance of the like sum left in the
hands of each of the three branches of agriculture,
after having discharged the tax</i>.</p>

<p>In a system of taxation which should be imposed
only on the land, an impost of 10 millions annually,
on a revenue of 60 millions, whether it fall
on the proprietor, or be divided between him, the
farmer, the cultivator, and other parties concerned,
requires of course an addition of 25 <i>per cent.</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the price of the productions of the earth, that
agriculture may not be sacrificed to industry; but
it must be observed, that immediately after the reaction
of the one upon the other shall be completed,
the burden of the tax will evidently be
<i>null</i>, since <i>the price of labour will have increased
equally in both, in proportion to that of their respective
products</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading27"><i>Reflexions on the foregoing System.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>This system was devised to countenance
and encourage agriculture; it is in her hands,
they say, it is at that fountain-head of riches,
that riches must be sought for; it is the land that
finally pays for all; the impost then must be laid
on the net produce of the land.—I shall venture
some reflexions on a subject which appears to me
the more important, as one of the wisest, and
the most profound speeches ever delivered in the
House of Lords, seems to hint at the expediency
of an aggravation of the burden already laid on
agriculture.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the spring of life; it is not the
spring of those riches which we call money:
money must be had for taxes; money flows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
from the hands of industry alone: it is then from
this spring that money must be drawn.</p>

<p>Besides, how is it known that the money,
wrested from agriculture, is not necessary to her
support? Or how does it escape observation,
that all the money which is not laid out by the
cultivator upon agriculture, will necessarily revert
to industry, either by the immediate consumption
of the cultivator, or by that which he
shall have occasioned on the part of the person to
whom he shall have lent the value of what he
has not consumed himself?</p>

<p>How comes it to be known, that the proprietor
of a landed estate that yields him, we shall
suppose, 800<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and who is charged
200<i>l.</i> for taxes, is not indebted in 300<i>l.</i> out of the
remaining 600<i>l.</i>? Now, it is true that 300<i>l.</i> are
sufficient for his support; but were those 200<i>l.</i>
which are forced from him, laid out annually on
his land, they would certainly in very few years
raise its produce from 800 to 1000<i>l.</i>—What is
that but to assess unjustly a man who enjoys only
500<i>l.</i> as high as another whose income amounts
to 800<i>l.</i>—to tie down agriculture to 800 when
it might rise to 1000; to deprive industry of the
re-action produced by that benefit; to crush population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
in the very bud, and consequently to
prevent a more considerable consumption; in
fine, to deprive government beforehand of the
amount of those taxes which that increase of population
and consumption would have secured
to the State?</p>

<p>It may be said in <i>France</i>, it is true, that by a
tax laid on private loan-covenants, those inconveniences
are partly removed; but this very
removal is only an additional obstacle, thrown in
the way of agriculture, to impede its progress;—the
man who could lend to the cultivator, besides
the fear of not receiving back his money when
wanted, has before his eyes the certainty of being
charged with the twentieth penny laid on the interest
of the money thus advanced, and consequently,
as often as he conveniently can, lends
that money to a merchant, who besides his punctuality
in paying at the fixed time, never hesitates
to allow the usual interest without any deduction
whatever.</p>

<p>It may be said also in <i>England</i>, that all over
<i>Great Britain</i>, the land-tax, (which, like some
others, is perhaps no more than a real poll-tax
under a name less grating to a <i>British</i>
ear) does not exceed the sum of about 2 millions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
out of 14 or 15, the whole amount of her
taxes; but nothing can be deduced therefrom, but
that it is subject only to a proportionable share
of the inconveniences above stated; inconveniences
which are inseparable from it: we may
add, that it is indeed free from some further
grievances which fall heavy on the <i>French</i> cultivator:—but
can the <i>English</i> boast of their tax
being founded on an invariable principle, when
this very principle is unjust in its consequences,
and, as often as necessity requires the tax to be
advanced, multiplies the injustice which follows
it?—Yet they hint at the expediency of increasing
that very tax, in order to alleviate the
imaginary burden that weighs down industry!—Some
pretend that the land-tax is become a <i>public
property</i>; they suppose that all such sales and
purchases of land as have taken place since the
year 1740, have been effected on that principle
of renunciation of the capital, the interest of
which is paid by that land-tax:—they infer, no
doubt, that the intention of those who did not
sell, was implicitly included in that of those who
have actually sold; for they propose that all the
present proprietors shall redeem the tax, in order
to refund part of the national debt; as if, on the
very next day after the redemption, Government
had not a right to renew it, if some fresh exigency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
should start, which could not be answered by any
other means.</p>

<p>In the critical moment of a discredit, which
will always be imputable to the Minister, when
the King and the People are fully acquainted with
their real interest, if administration, not knowing
what to do, does not hesitate to apply to the
land proprietor, whose ways and means are
always visible, and whose purse lies, as it were,
ever open against his own inclination, the Minister,
no doubt, finds his excuse in the necessity;
but after the crisis is over, why should the proprietor
be further aggrieved?</p>

<p>But, say they, the amount of the tax cannot
be dispensed with;—no objection can be urged
against necessity; <i>all that is wanted, is the least
that can possibly be given; just as all that is
wanted, is the most that it can be advantageous to
take</i>: but the whole should be paid by each individual,
only in proportion to his faculties:—Now
the fact is, that the faculties of the land
proprietors are not better known than those of the
merchants;—<i>the latter have found means to prove,
to persuade, that they ought not to be taxed, but in
proportion to their consumption, the only criterion of
their riches</i>, or at least that part of their riches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
which they do not lay out in increasing commercial
wealth.—<span class="smcap">Is the improvement of the
territorial wealth less essential, or
less valuable to the State?</span></p>

<p>Let us examine, however, in what degree the
taxes laid on the different articles of consumption,
must enhance the price of goods, in order that
agriculture may not suffer more than industry. If
it should result from this research, that many
previous false steps have raised the greatest obstacles
against the execution of those measures
which would prove the most equitable, without
being more disadvantageous in any point of view;
the inconvenience of such obstacles might be
deemed trifling, when <i>compared with the burden
supposed to be transmitted to posterity</i>. And it is
not in <i>England</i> that an important truth, generally
acknowledged, will long remain without
effect; it is not in <i>England</i> that an important
truth will long remain without being generally
acknowledged.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading28"><i>Effects of an Impost exclusively laid on the Articles
of Consumption peculiar to the rich, or in other
words, <span class="upright">on Luxury</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The immediate effect of a tax, is to raise the
price of the object on which it is laid, by at least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the whole amount of the tax: <i>nothing can be
more just</i>; but it is at the same time a consideration
which ought to keep pace with the one I
have already offered, on the very positive <i>object</i>
of all kinds of taxation, namely, <i>to secure the sum
at which the product of the impost is valued, whatever
that sum may be</i>.</p>

<p>Now, in order to estimate justly the system of
taxation we are considering, it must be presented
in all its glory, that is, such as all Ministers of
finance in <i>Europe</i> seem to wish it; such as all
the <i>English</i> news-papers recommend it, rather
roughly, each of them at least once a week; such
as all Oppositions, past, present, and future, have
pretended, do pretend, and ever will pretend it to
be, so easy and so equitable; such as all preachers
of the <i>Roman</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>Jansenist</i> and <i>Presbyterian</i>
persuasion, are wont to deliver it
every day among the private societies whom
they are pleased to honour with their partly
christian, partly political reflexions, and would
speak it out from the pulpit, if Ministers of
finance had any leisure to hear their sermons,
&amp;c. I shall therefore suppose that the tax of 10
millions, mentioned in the three foregoing articles,
should be assessed in so able, so <i>charitable</i>
a manner, that 5 millions should fall on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
landlord, and the other 5 on the richest proprietor
of money. I shall begin with the most essential,
for the State is certainly founded on the landed
property.</p>

<p>What is the revenue of the land-proprietor?⸺Nothing
more, all expences defrayed, than
the third part of the real produce of his lands;
and this third is, in the <i>hypothesis</i>, estimated at
20 millions only.—These 20 millions finding in
the hands of industry, that portion which usually
gave the balance of those 20 millions, raised to
25 millions by means of the tax, it clearly appears
that the proprietor alluded to is short by
25 <i>per cent.</i> of the sum required to pay that portion.—In
this case what is he to do?</p>

<p>Shall he leave industry in possession of one
fifth of his former comforts?—Then industry
would be debarred from the sale of that fifth
part; one fifth of its artificers would be left
without any other resource than that which the
highway might afford, <i>and the main object of the
taxation would be defeated in the following year</i>,
unless exportation should make up to industry
for the want of home-consumption, (<i>the only one
by which a State can prosper</i>,) and the <i>deficit</i> of
the tax laid on the home-consumption, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
be compensated by another tax on foreign consumption,
that is <i>on the exports</i>.</p>

<p>We shall suppose this to be the case, and
that industry actually exports that fifth part
of the national commodities which the land
proprietor is not able any longer to consume,
and which, nevertheless, industry is
compelled to sell, in order to be reimbursed
the tax she has advanced, and be prepared
to answer the fresh demand which next year
government will have occasion to make.—But
if it were to such means that <i>England</i> should
stand indebted for part of the increase in her exports,
her industry, methinks, would have derived
less advantage therefrom, than a home-sale
might have procured, even supposing the
inconvenience of which I shall speak presently:
it appears to me also, that the land proprietors
would, in that case, have some reason to complain,
and that the rest of the nation would have
no cause to boast of the immensity of her exportation.—The
draw-backs granted on the very
exportation of the taxed commodities, prove that
such an expedient never was adopted in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>Will the land proprietor come to a resolution
to fly from his native country, in search of another,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
where good men content themselves with
declaiming against luxury, without making any
attempt to destroy it? No, he never did, nor
ever will take that resolution; he is fast bound
to his land by the roots of every plant he has laid
on it.—What then is he to do? It behoves the
Minister of finance to give him some wholesome
advice.</p>

<p>If the Minister be silent, or if he shuffle, because
he is closely watched by Opposition, he
must equally lose his popularity; for the land
proprietor, left to shift for himself, will raise the
price of the productions of his land, in proportion
as the tax has increased that part of the products
of industry that concerns him.—</p>

<p>But his 20 millions revenue, have, as I have
said, the same component parts as the 40 millions
which he is obliged to give up for the expences
of cultivation, and other incumbrances attending
property:—he cannot therefore increase them to
25 millions, without raising by one twelfth the
total amount of the 60 millions of landed revenue;
this will at once carry up the quarter of wheat
from 40<i>s.</i> to 43<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>: this is therefore an advance
of 8⅓ <i>per cent.</i> on his commodities:—upon which
we must observe, that no increase will take place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
in the wages of the mechanic, or of the husbandman;
for the objects of luxury are the only ones
which we suppose to have been taxed: such is
the <i>infernal</i> side of this <i>heavenly</i> system.—Yet
this is not all.</p>

<p>What is the money-proprietor to do, not having
it in his power to raise the price of his money
as the landed proprietor can do that of his wheat,
but who, on the contrary, is invariably limited
to the same nominal revenue, whilst the tax of
the other 5 millions, which the <i>humanity</i> of the
<i>taxator</i> had levelled at him, has occasioned a
rise of 25 <i>per cent.</i> in the nominal value of those
articles of luxury in which he indulged himself?—He
will, he must leave them in the hands of
industry, and confine himself to such objects as
are not taxed; it is a resource, as it is at the
same time a compulsive measure.—<i>The produce of
the tax will then be inadequate to the want</i>: a second
impost must then be thought on, to supply
the <i>deficit</i> of the first.—<i>Fall again upon luxury</i>,
cry the enthusiasts; <i>this is more necessary than
ever, for bread is already 8⅓ per cent. dearer than
it was, and the land proprietors have abated nothing
of their luxury; they ride still in their chariots,
whilst the poor loaded porter constantly trudges
on foot</i>. Enthusiasts will never see further, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
those who are not enthusiasts do not yet see far
enough; for they only say <i>that it is expedient
for government, that the prices of commodities be
kept up, in order to facilitate the payment of the impost</i>.—Yet,
<i>if it is expedient</i> for government, that
the prices be <i>kept up</i> to <i>facilitate</i> the payment of
the impost, I conclude that it is an <i>absolute necessity</i>
for government, that the prices do increase,
when there is no other visible means to establish
<i>the possibility</i> of paying taxes. I therefore have
to answer only to the enthusiasts, and let it be as
the enthusiasts will have it:⸺</p>

<p>But the first 5 millions of the <i>charitable</i> tax
could not be paid, without an advanced price of
8⅓ <i>per cent.</i> on all the productions of the earth,
without raising the wheat from 40<i>s.</i> to 43<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>—it
will then be necessary to increase its price by
as much again; it must advance from 43<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
to 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in order that the tax be paid <i>without
foreign assistance</i>. Then all will be settled,
regulated, balanced, and paid between the <i>capitalists</i>
of land and those of industry; <i>but as no
objects will have been taxed but those of luxury</i>, how
long will it be before the people, the labouring
man can see justice done to him?—Ten popular
insurrections perhaps will be required to extort
it. Yet let us suppose that the very first proves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
sufficient to procure it complete, that is, that
their wages be raised 16⅔ <i>per cent.</i> as the tax
after all the necessary re-actions has increased the
price of the produce of their labour:—in this case,
instead of the 20 millions allowed before to each
of the two classes of working men, cultivators and
mechanics, they will then receive 23,333,333<i>l.</i>
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>—But how will you wrest from the
hands of the land proprietor 3,333,333<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
out of the portion which he was obliged to
lay by, <i>that the tax might be paid by his consumption</i>,
without his advancing again the price of
his commodities in such a proportion as will
return him the new sum which he is forced to
pay?—And were he not to augment again the
price of his commodities, would not then a new
tax become necessary to supply the <i>deficit</i> which
the rise of wages of the labouring men must occasion
in the consumption of their employers?—The
land proprietor will then add still to the
price of his goods;—but will not this addition,
<i>equally necessary as the two first</i>, be productive
of a further necessity of raising in proportion the
price of labour, the wages of the labouring
man?—No doubt; and another insurrection
would procure justice, if the thought did not
occur at last of observing, that <i>the class of
labouring men being, before the tax, in possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
of one third of the general revenue, forms, in this
respect, a third interest equal to one half of the two
other</i>. Now, the tax having enforced an advance
in prices of 16⅔, to shelter the two former from
its effect, there must also be, in favour of the
third interest, a third increase of 8⅓, which
rising at last to 25 <i>per cent.</i> more, the price of
labour, as that of its produce, both in regard to
land and industry, will exactly leave to each of
the three interests, under the denomination of
<i>twenty-five</i>, the same comforts as each of them
enjoyed under that of <i>twenty</i> before the tax was
laid.</p>

<p>In regard therefore to the effects of the tax
on the prices of provisions, there is not the
least difference between the system of taxing
luxury, and that of a land-tax; 50<i>s.</i> in the
supposition of an impost of ten millions, would
prove in either system the <i>necessary</i> price of
wheat; for if ever a price can be termed <i>necessary</i>,
it is when it cannot be lower without
effecting the ruin of the land proprietor, and
even <i>without missing the sole and indispensable end
of taxation</i>, unless recourse be had to one of the
following resources:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Either</i></p>

<p>To export such commodities, which, as it
might be absurdly supposed, the nation is no
longer able to consume,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>To steal from the people the proportionable
increase <i>due to them</i> in the price of their labour,
if they should prove so complaisant as tamely to
submit, out of gratitude, for <i>the tax being laid
only upon luxury</i>.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this article with a reflexion
which may give birth to many others.</p>

<p>The impost on <i>luxury</i>, which, after a very little
time, as we have seen, proves no ways injurious
to those who were able to pay for the objects upon
which the tax was laid, is besides, under another
point of view, really advantageous to those very
men who seem the only contributors to it; <i>because</i>
it sets entirely above the reach of the people,
a number of articles in which they would indulge
themselves, <i>to the great benefit of the tax</i>,
and which, though perhaps intended <i>by the general
provider</i>, as well for the poor as for the
rich, are nevertheless, by the <i>merciful</i> system
of taxation, exclusively reserved to the rich.—Is
this the intention of the <i>merciful taxator</i>?—in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
my opinion it ought not to be that of an <i>intelligent
one</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading29"><i>Effects of a merciless Tax upon all the Articles of
the most general Consumption.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Instead of laying a tax <i>on men</i>, from whom,
without rushing with open eyes into the perpetration
of a thousand injuries, it is impossible
to require any thing more than a <i>personal service</i>,
when it is necessary and <i>possible</i> withal; instead
of taxing <i>the land</i>, from which nothing can be
expected but food, and the rough materials to
which industry can give from one to many hundred
degrees of value; instead of taxing that
imaginary monster called <i>luxury</i>, which procures
so substantial a support to some, and such pleasing
comforts to others, lay your tax solely, and
without predilection, on <i>all those products of
national and foreign industry which are more generally
consumed</i>; then, in my opinion, you will
have reason to flatter yourself that riches are
taxed to their very source, and without inconvenience
to any one, since you tax it in the hands
of those who are, <i>by the strictest justice</i>, authorised
to a benefit for all the advances made by them to
the consumer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>So then, though the tax of 10 millions be
fixed on certain parts of industry, nothing will
prevent the whole from rising proportionably;
and for this, <i>God alone be thanked</i>. The whole
will be then 70 millions instead of 60;—upon
which the least reflexion is sufficient to make us
feel the necessity of the re-actions mentioned in
the foregoing system, <i>but with this difference</i>, that
the general consumption having been taxed, the
two <i>capitalists</i> cannot, even on the very day
when the impost takes place, shut their eyes
against the justice of increasing the salary of the
labouring man in a due proportion.—Now,
<i>the interest</i> of the two capitalists could not, as in
the preceding system, be preserved undiminished,
but by an increase from 60 to 70 millions, that
is to say, 16⅔ <i>per cent.</i>—Now, <i>the interest</i> of the
labouring man is, as has been observed before,
equal to one half of the other two classes in the
general revenue, or, in other words, equal to
either;—it will therefore become necessary,
in order to restore the former equilibrium, to
introduce a fresh increase of 8⅓ <i>per cent.</i> upon
every thing;—in consequence of which the price
of labour, being raised 25 <i>per cent.</i> just as its
products, both in cultivation and industry, will
leave also the two classes of labourers in the
same situation they were in previous to the tax;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
each of them was then in possession of 20 millions
out of 60, each will now get 25 out of 75.</p>

<p>I think also that <i>then</i>, a Minister of finance,
ever so anxious about his operations, ever so zealous
for the establishment of none but <i>productive</i>
taxes, could not conceive a single article of consumption
that might suffer by this arrangement;
it would appear too evidently that every one
would <i>then</i> have the very same faculty of consuming,
manufacturing, or saving, under the
denomination of 25, all that he had before consumed,
manufactured, or saved under the denomination
of 20.</p>

<p>It would also be seen <i>then</i>, that the success of
those taxes termed <i>productive</i>, is not to be
ascribed to the abilities of the <i>taxator</i>, but to the
abilities of the persons <i>taxed</i>, who have taken
care to right themselves by so much as the <i>taxator</i>
ought to have been afraid of being unjust.</p>

<p><i>Then</i> also would every one be sensible, that
the advance in all the prices could not be only of
a 12th part, or 8⅓ <i>per cent.</i> as in the <i>glorious</i>
system of a poll-tax <i>established by Divine Justice</i>,
but of 25 <i>per cent.</i> neither <i>more nor less</i> than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the system of the <i>land-tax</i>, neither <i>more nor less</i>
than in the system of an exclusive tax <i>upon luxury</i>;
that consequently <i>wheat</i>, as well as produce
of any other sort, as well as <i>labour</i> which
gives the whole, <i>would be indebted to the tax for
a fifth part of its new nominal value</i>, and that
50<i>s.</i> would be the <i>medium</i> price of wheat;—its
<i>necessary</i> price, but not more <i>necessary</i> in that
<i>merciless</i> taxation, than in the <i>merciful</i> one laid
on the exclusive consumption of the rich:—and
this calls for the attention of every individual;
nor can it be too often repeated, because <i>then</i>
neither hypocrites, nor enthusiasts, nor good
men, nor manufacturers, nor farmers, nor proprietors,
could any longer deceive themselves
or others, on the price of labour; it would be
too self-evident that the said price ought to increase
with the taxes, and that no one would be
injured by that increase.</p>

<p>Then it would also appear, that some people
had very good reason to say, that the burden of
all taxes, falls one time or another, on the landed
property; but who could refuse to admit besides,
that I am tolerably founded in insisting,
that when taxes have in fine reached every part
of the whole, no one part can feel the weight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p><i>The money proprietor</i>, it will be said, the <i>lender
alone</i> will be aggrieved; he must lose the fifth
part of his usual comforts, he must pay 15 for
those articles which he could procure formerly
for 12.</p>

<p>I shall confine myself to three answers:</p>

<p>First, <i>Is it not self-evident, that any financiering
operation, which reduces from 5 to 4, the interest of
a national debt, deprives as well the lender of the
fifth part of his comforts, <span class="smcap">as if the nation had
loaded herself with ten millions more,
to be paid annually</span>? (such is the present hypothesis.)</i>
There stands, therefore, between the
two cases no other difference, but the <i>palpable</i>
justice and necessity of the one, and I believe we
may say, the <i>unsuspected</i> inutility and injustice
of the other.</p>

<p>Secondly, We have already seen that the loss
of the lender, in all cases, flows essentially from
the nature of his capital; that it is inseparable
from the advance of prices, whether <i>that advance</i>
originates from an accession of wealth, or is produced
by taxes, or brought on by monopoly;
and that besides, by lending to the State, with
the certainty that the State could not pay the interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of the loan without the assistance of an
import, he has beforehand submitted to the
effects of an impost <i>indispensable</i> to his main
object.</p>

<p>Thirdly, If we except a poll-tax, which we
should suppose <i>laid by Divine Justice</i>, and which,
in the present hypothesis, should wrest from the
lender only a twelfth part of his enjoyments,
where is the system, which, <i>in the supposition of
a tax of ten millions, being now necessary in England</i>,
would not deprive him of a fifth part of those
enjoyments?—We shall see presently that a <i>compound-tax</i>
would perhaps prove still less favourable;
but how much has he to dread, in all cases,
from the indirect taxation of the <i>monopoly</i>, which
it is impossible duly to estimate!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading30"><i>Effects of Compound Taxation.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The system of taxation, which may be called
general, is composed of the four different kinds
of taxes which I have just mentioned:—First,
some kind of <i>poll-tax</i>, under that or any other
name;—secondly, a <i>land-tax</i>;—thirdly, an impost
on the consumption of the rich, or <i>luxury</i>;—and
fourthly, in fine, the freedom taken with
<i>the consumption of the poor</i>, or general consumption;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
for the sun of reason forces its way through
the darkness of prejudices; these only serve to
retard the progress of nature wherever light first
began to shine. It would be easier to stifle
truth at first, than entirely to escape its effects.</p>

<p>No country in the world can be guarded
against the injustice inseparable from the <i>two first
parts</i> of the system of a compound-taxation,
whatever may be in that respect the wisdom of
the legislature, and its tenderness in the manner
of collecting the impost; no country can be free
from that other kind of injustice which results
from the general prejudice in favour of the tax
on luxury, which constitutes the <i>third part</i> of
the system under examination; but the <i>ensemble</i>—the
whole together, does not produce every
where the same effects on the prices.</p>

<p>In <i>France</i>, from the beginning of the present
century down to the time when Mons. <i>Turgot</i>
was intrusted with the department of the finances,
the sum of what I can collect from the <i>French</i>
mode of taxation, is, that without any determined
system, without any other rule than the immediate
want of money, and the facility of procuring
that money by means of a loan, at any
interest whatever, they had successively taxed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
whatever came first to hand, or occurred to the
imagination of the comptroller general for the
time being; nothing was spared, in order that
no one should complain; landed estates, employments,
money, individuals, the one because
he was industrious, the other because he had no
industry and <i>that he might acquire some</i>; this
man, because he had a <i>title</i>; that other, because
he had none; a third, on account of what he consumed;
a fourth, for that consumption to which
he was doomed,—(<i>an expedient which, together
with the galleys, was devised by the farmers
general, as an admirable stroke upon smuggling</i>).
No sin more venial, than to take some liberties
with a compound of such motley pieces; nothing
more severe than the reflexions thrown out
against it on the other side of the channel; and
nothing can more forcibly prove that <i>France</i> was
planning some reform on the subject, than the orders
given most minutely to enquire into the principles
and effects of the various modes of taxation
adopted in other parts of <i>Europe</i>. I think, in
regard to all those parts of <i>French</i> taxation, which
I have alluded to, as every intelligent man does
in <i>France</i> and <i>England</i>: nevertheless, if one cannot
positively affirm, that the result of such a
chaos of strange regulations, has been, that every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
one perceiving the burden to be general, nobody
ever thought of easing himself at the expence
of others who appeared to have been loaded in
the same manner, yet it cannot be contradicted,
that, notwithstanding the want of true principles
on the part of the <i>taxator</i> in <i>France</i>, the price of
every thing might have continued to this day,
without material alteration, had it not been for
an event, of which I shall speak in the sequel;
and if it were true, as some very deep politicians
will have it, that <i>the more depreciated commodities
are in a country, the quicker that nation advances
towards opulence, because, in such a case,
the national manufacturer has it in his power to
favour the foreigner by underselling all other countries
in the world</i>; if this principle were not at
least questionable, as I hope to prove it by and
by, every one would admit that the <i>compound-taxation</i>,
<span class="smcap">even compounded</span>, as I have just
described it, does not appear totally destitute of
some advantages.</p>

<p>Before I venture to express my thoughts on
the subject, I wish the reader would form to
himself an idea of what might be the effect of
such a system in <i>England</i>;—in <i>England</i>, where
every man is a calculator, and adds without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
ceremony, on the creditor side of his books, the
number of figures necessary to balance those
which he thinks too many in the calculation of
others. They say in <i>England</i>, and there they
are more bitterly persuaded than any where else,
that taxes take annually out of the pockets of
those who pay them, the whole amount of the impost;
but <i>there</i> as every where, and <i>there</i> much
sooner than in any other part of the world, justice
and reason never fail to put into the head of each
individual, what he is to do, that the tax be not
paid for a long while out of his own pocket. I
may therefore boldly say, that nothing more is
wanted on the part of <i>England</i>, to join perfectly
in opinion with me, concerning the most important
point (that which concerns the national
debt), than to observe, that every one has always
done as secretly and as expeditiously as he could,
for himself alone, what I insist it would be advantageous
to do openly, with equal celerity, for the
general good<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. I now resume my subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>It would be, methinks, a difficult matter not
to conclude, from such very reasonable conflict of
private calculations, that, were the <i>French</i> system
to be adopted in <i>England</i>, it would not, in that
<i>land of benediction</i>, experience the fate of exotic
plants; far from degenerating, far from keeping
the price of all things at the lowest ebb, it
would acquire from the influence of general
maxims, and from universal custom, the weight
necessary to balance that multitude of private
injuries, from which it is impossible to keep it
free. Now, this cannot be effected without
forcing the price of every thing up to a pitch so
much more extravagant, as each man, in such
a case, is the natural judge of the indemnity he
should allow himself for the tax imposed, and
for the advantage that others derive from it; if
any one should shrink on the occasion, he finds
in his <i>corporation</i> a degree of vigour, of which
he shares the benefit. The word of the law is
the only bridle in <i>England</i>; a tax of 4<i>s.</i> on a
particular article, increases its known price only
by something more; but if government gets
50,000<i>l.</i> from a tax, under the appellation of
<i>licence</i>, or any other name, which leaves the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
thus taxed, supreme judge of the rate, and at
liberty to choose the means of indemnifying himself,
one may rest assured that such a tax costs the
people six times as much as it brings in to government.
Let every man candidly weigh this (I
don’t say undenied, but I say) undeniable assertion,
from the circumstances of the moment;
let him examine what remains to be done by
the land proprietor, that he may not be most
shamefully ransomed; let him judge in what
predicament that man must stand, whose fixed
revenue in money, affords him no resource against
the effects produced by such an emulation; let
him observe, above all, that the daily labourer
will not, <i>before the matter is brought to the last
extremity</i>, be paid one penny more, <i>because care
has been charitably taken to tax almost none of the
articles of his consumption; and let him then</i>, if he
dares to do it, <i>let him bless the tax on luxury</i>, and
any other kind of impost, <i>but such as is laid on the
objects of most general consumption</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>real</i> necessity of providing for the interest
due on the debt contracted during the last war,
and the <i>imaginary</i> advantage of the intended
reimbursement, have compelled the present Ministry
(and according to the maxims and ideas
that predominate at this time, would have compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
all possible administrations) to impose
many taxes of the very exceptionable kind; to
their effects add those of the indirect tax of
corporations, premiums, prohibitions, and new
obstacles thrown in the smuggler’s way, it will
not be wonderful that the million sterling for
the <i>imaginary</i> want of a reimbursement, together
with the three millions some hundred thousands,
for the <i>real</i> want, (the interest of the debt) and
which, at the word, ought not to increase the
total mass of prices much above 8 <i>per cent.</i>
actually advance them to 12, whilst in <i>France</i>
the expences of the late war will not perhaps
occasion, <i>at first</i>, a rise of more than 6 <i>per cent.</i>
It will be seen in the sequel why I say, <i>at first</i>.</p>

<p>But, they say in <i>France</i>—but, they say in <i>England</i>,
all the articles of consumption are already
so loaded, that it is impossible to think of increasing
the weight. The <i>French</i> Farmers General
themselves tremble when they propose to
increase the duties on any article; <i>will not consumption
suffer by it</i>?—Such is every where the
terrible argument that prevents the establishment
of the only unexceptionable system, the only
equitable, and the only advantageous one to the
people—to the people, on whose account they
pretend to be so anxious.—That system, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
true, would lessen by one half, <i>the nominal value</i>
of those operations that are held in so important
a light, of all those tricks of which the contrivers
themselves entertain so high an opinion;
but what ease, what leisure would not this very
system procure to the Minister! Let us then
see whether the formidable argument, on which
is grounded the impossibility of doing <i>the best</i>,
will bear the analysis, so <i>formidable</i> also in so
many cases.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading31"><i>Some Doubts on the supposed Impossibility of laying
all Taxes on Consumption.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The universal voice in <i>England</i> is, that so
many taxes should be laid, as are necessary to answer
the exigences. Ministry, Opposition, Subjects,
all agree in this essential point; but if we except
some taxes which bear principally on the land
proprietor, who never says any thing, and whose
silence commands that of every one who shares
in his burden, the ablest man in the three kingdoms
is not capable of proposing one, on any
article, which would not be followed by a petition
from those very men who do not even wait till it
has received the royal sanction, in order to derive
from it an extravagant advantage, if it be
within the meaning of <i>licences</i>, and perhaps only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
a profit <i>rather above</i> a reasonable one, if it bears
on an object properly specified.</p>

<p>I have perused several of these petitions; and
the substance of what has appeared to me most striking
in every one of them is nearly this: “Let
every thing be taxed in <i>England</i>, nothing more
equitable; let every thing be taxed, <i>every thing</i>,
except all the things that concern your humble
petitioners: you cannot tax them, without
ruining their trade; and not only their
trade, but also the whole trade of the nation at
large; and not only without ruining the whole
trade of the nation at large, but without stifling
that principle of liberty, that noble spirit of
life, which has so highly distinguished her
above all the nations in the world.”</p>

<p>Were any one to infer, from the foregoing
extract, that my intention is to stigmatize the use
of <i>petitions</i>,—notwithstanding the most invincible
antipathy I bear to exclamations, which,
for the most part, betray either weakness or
hypocrisy, I should exclaim, O Divine Liberty,
of <i>humbly shewing</i>, to the most respectable
parts of a nation, all kinds of ideas, whether absurd
or reasonable! Divine Liberty, never treated in
<i>England</i> but with that regard which is due from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
one man to whatever comes from another man!
Divine Liberty, who givest to the Legislator,
the time, knowledge, and often the means, necessary
to prevent him from falling into such
errors as it is not beyond the power of human nature
to avoid, ... be thou ever blessed, and
mayest thou be worshipped wherever men are
not infallible, and wherever millions of men
may suffer from a single mistake!</p>

<p>In <i>England</i>, the produce of taxes on the various
articles of consumption, amounts, I suppose, to
8,000,000<i>l.</i>: in order to procure the 5 or 6
other millions required, a part of which is necessary,
a part of which is supposed to be so on
account of the plan of a reimbursement, the
land continues to be taxed for 2 millions, and the
other 3 or 4 are taken from perhaps 30 different
articles, one of which will bring in 150, another
100, a third 60, a fourth 30 thousand
pounds, &amp;c. with a salvo for Government to
tax half a score more articles, if it should be
robbed rather too unconscionably on the produce
of the former; for, in all countries
throughout the world, this is all the conjuration
in that part of the administration of finances
which relates to the collecting of taxes; if you
rob Government in one point, be sure Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
will ransom you, if required, on ten
others; nothing more just, but nothing more
easy.</p>

<p>Now, if we lay it down for an indubitable
maxim, that the most able Administrator of
finances, cannot take from an individual, more
than what he possesses, it seems to me then that
it remains only to examine, whether that very
individual from whom, one way or another, out
of the 20 he is possessed of, 5 may be wrested,—will
be less aggrieved if the 5 be taken out of
his pocket, and he be sent to market with the
remaining 15, than he would be, were he permitted
to go with the whole 20 to market,
where he would find those 15 which he used to
purchase for 15, charged with the 5 which might
have been taken from him at home?</p>

<p>The question more to the point is yet more
singular; for it goes to this enquiry:</p>

<p>First, Whether the land proprietor, who is
obliged to give at a fixed period three millions
in taxes for his land, windows, domestics, and
other objects more recently taxed, would think
himself more injured if those three millions
were divided and laid upon some objects of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
consumption, while he should observe that by
this new order of things he would gain the convenience,
not only of paying these three millions
by different and remote installments, but
also of making use of the money previous to such
payment,—without injury to the trader, to whom
the interest would be one way or other repaid,—while
on the other hand, a part of the money,
laid out upon his land, would furnish new resources
for augmenting the produce of the taxes,
by increasing his faculties of consumption:</p>

<p>Secondly, Whether those unfortunate licensed
persons, and others (who so bitterly complain of
all the various taxes that produce to them three
or four times the sum which they advance to
Government) would not be <i>justly</i>, as they ought
to be, relieved from the <i>oppression</i> (that is the
word) if such taxes were taken off, and laid on
articles of which they would themselves be the
consumers:</p>

<p>Thirdly, Whether all those extraordinary,
usurious, and unjust benefits, arising from those
<i>oppressive</i> taxes which I have been mentioning,
reduced to their proper point, by taxes that would
not increase the price of any article beyond a
known degree, would not naturally reduce the
<i>value</i> of every thing to that <i>necessary</i> price I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
spoken of,—to that price which every thing ought
to maintain, that the imaginary <i>oppressed</i> might not
actually <i>oppress</i> the imaginary <i>oppressors</i>,—that all
things may be preserved in a just balance, without
any person experiencing a change in his condition;—and
consequently, without the consumption of
any article being diminished, unless fancy or
fashion should transfer it to another article that
will indemnify for the deficiency.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>From <i>England</i> let us pass over to <i>France</i>,
and always taking for granted that a Minister of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
finance is not a conjurer, and that he can take
from the pockets of the people no more money
than they possess; I wish it could be examined:</p>

<p>Whether the 41 millions of <i>livres Tournois</i>,
produced by the poll-tax, and which should be
paid no longer, when that tax should be transferred
to, and divided between all the articles <i>of the most
general consumption, and of course the most productive</i>,
would diminish the general faculties, by
increasing the value of those objects, to the whole
of that sum which the contributors would gain
by paying no longer the poll-tax.</p>

<p>I would have it also enquired into, whether
the clergy, finding the objects of that general
consumption loaded with 11 millions more,
could be aggrieved by the sole disappointment of
giving no longer <i>gratuitously</i> to his Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
those 11 millions which they are now <i>compelled</i> to
pay; and whether they would not be left in possession
of all the faculties necessary to satisfy
the first article, as soon as they should be freed
from the other.</p>

<p>I should also wish the <i>French</i> to examine whether
the 76 millions <i>Tournois</i>, paid in that country
for the <i>three twentieths</i>, instead of being very
often called for, <i>at a time when the Subject has
them not</i>, transferred to those objects which cannot
be consumed but by means of the money
remaining after those 76 millions are discharged,
would impair the means of the contributors, although
after having eased them of that truly terrible
tax, the Minister should, in a manner,
juggle them out of the whole amount of it, by
another impost on consumption. Supposing
even they had some suspicion of the trick, I
wish it were examined whether they would think
themselves injured by paying in the new way
that amount, by installments at their own time,
and till then laying out a part of it upon their
lands, the revenues of which would of course increase
in proportion.</p>

<p>But above all, I wish it should be examined,
whether 91 millions of another kind of subsidy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
called <i>la taille</i>, added to 7 millions and a half
more, laid out in expences for warrants and distresses,
necessary to enforce the law of the subsidy,
transferred upon the consumption of those
from whose hands the <i>subsidy</i> is directly wrested,
against whom the <i>warrants</i> are issued, upon
whose goods or body the distresses are executed,
would diminish the faculty of that poor people’s
consumption, if, by means of that consumption, by
the suppression of the old <i>subsidy</i>, of <i>warrants</i>, and
<i>distresses</i> attending the same, they should acquire the
faculty of consuming cheerfully, what they often
consume in bitterness and sorrow; and whether
the department of the finances could lose by it
any thing more than the pleasure or trouble, or
rather the necessity of assessing a dreadful subsidy,
issuing out warrants, and distressing the body—when
there are no goods to be distrained.</p>

<p><i>But in this scheme the expence is more considerable.</i></p>

<p>This is the grand objection: <i>The expence is
more considerable!</i> Reduce the unfortunate to
a bed of straw, or cast him into prison, to spare
the purse ... of whom?—For after all,
supposing even that a few additional charges
ought to be compared with millions of inconveniences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
injuries, and acts of barbarity, which
are inseparable from the other methods, let it be
examined whether the extra charges can produce
any other effect, than that of advancing by a few
<i>deniers pour livrè</i> the general price of merchandise;
let it be examined whether that advance
is not a matter of perfect indifference, provided
that the price of the provisions sold by the land
proprietor, <i>who is stiled rich</i>, and that of the
wages of the labouring man, who <i>is called poor</i>,
rise in the same proportion as the goods of the
<i>capitalist</i> of industry, who stands equally and as
essentially in need of the ease of the <i>poor</i>, as of
the opulence of the <i>rich</i>.</p>

<p>In fine, Let it be examined whether there is
any thing great, courageous, just, and fair,
that may not be expected from the <i>French</i> nation,
when she shall be admitted to the honour of being
heard,—or when they will be kind enough to
convince her.—A King of <i>France</i>, with the
trifling help of his provincial administrations,
may do, and play with every thing: a King
of <i>France</i> is truly a despot; not from that
absurd right of giving his <i>will</i> for <i>reason</i>,
but from that principle which is congenial to
the <i>French</i>, that the People and the King are
but one, have but one interest, and have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
to fear but the ignorance of a Minister,
conscious of his inability, without the least
thought of the resources he has at hand in such a
case, without principles to guard him against
committing those injuries which seem to him unavoidable,
in order to conceal the errors which he
has been, or fears to be, guilty of; a Minister,
in fine, whose insignificant little self, wrests from
the King and People, the fruit of that <i>identity</i>
which forms the acknowledged essence of the
<i>French</i> constitution.</p>

<p>What seems to be in <i>France</i> no more than a
fortunate prejudice, is every where an irrefragable
truth: in every country the strength,
power, and riches of the Prince, are but the sum
of the force, power, riches, energy, honour and
<i>susceptibility</i>, which actually exist in the mass of
his subjects.—But if the Sovereign be the most
powerful man in his kingdom, only because all
its strength centers in him; if in this age, the
most complaisant, the meanest Minister should
not dare even to insinuate a contrary idea before
the Prince the most jealous of his authority;
how can he presume to think, or to hope, that
it will be in his power to persuade the Prince,
that he, the Minister, is the best informed man
in the Empire, before he has collected all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
information that can be got on every object that
does not call for an immediate execution?—And
how can he pretend to have collected every such
information, when in addition to his own ideas,
he goes only by those of the few dependents who
surround him, dependents as much on their
guard before him, as he himself is circumspect
before the Sovereign, when the Sovereign, before
he asks his advice, has the misfortune to let
a single word escape that betrays even the appearance
of an opinion on the object under deliberation?</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading32"><i>Recapitulation of the foregoing Thoughts on Taxes
and their Effects.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The fate of the various kinds of taxes, is
similar to that of political operations, which
pretty regularly bring about the very contrary
of what had been expected from them: thus if
you tax the consumption of the rich, presently
the poor alone will pay the impost, and will continue
to pay it till an insurrection will make
you sensible that he is brought too low; now this
insurrection is commonly the consequence of a
trifling scarcity, which, it seems, Providence sends
to the unfortunate in order to encourage his asking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
for justice, in the only manner that is likely to
prove successful: on the contrary, let the tax be
laid on the general consumption, without sparing
that of the poor, the man who possesses, shall be,
no doubt, necessitated to pay for the man who
has nothing, if the former wishes to enjoy the labour
of the latter; and on the very same day, when
the tax is laid on the consumption of the labouring
man, he will not hesitate to demand an increase of
wages to the full amount.... How is he to be
deceived?—If it be well to deceive the poor as
long as possible, then tax nothing but the consumption
of the rich. But whatever be the manner
in which the impost is laid, as soon as its
effect shall be general, the burden will prove
<i>null</i> (<span class="smcap">save the injuries inseparable from
all other taxes, but those that bear
upon consumption</span>): this effect is no more
than a general advance in all the prices: an advance,
it is true, already acknowledged necessary
with regard to the taxed articles, but
dreaded hitherto in regard to all the rest, <i>where
it ought to have been wished for</i>; universally felt,
but never justly estimated; the <i>nullity</i> of the
burden of the debt would have been determined
by the estimation.</p>

<p>The poll-tax, <i>supposed to be established by Divine
Justice</i>, would enhance the price of labour, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
of its products, but by a fraction equal to that
which the amount of the tax should be, in the
mass of both revenues, land and industry. Ten
millions of a poll-tax on a revenue of 120,
would increase the prices of every thing by one
twelfth; and every man thus taxed, would evidently
after the advance of prices, in consequence
of such a poll-tax, find himself in the very same
state he stood in before the tax; yet one twelfth
more must be given for every thing, but then
one twelfth more would be received for every
thing.</p>

<p>All other kinds of taxes, as well as the poll-tax,
seem to affect only the article on which they are
laid; but this article comprehends the three
interests, and trebles the action of the tax when
the interest of the labouring man, that is, the
price of his day’s work, constitutes, as it does in
<i>England</i>, nearly one third of the revenue.⸺How
could it be supposed that the taxing of industry
in its products, was granting to its <i>capitalist</i>
the <i>right</i> of increasing his price by the
whole amount of the tax, without making it
<i>necessary</i> for the land proprietor to enhance the
price of his commodities at the same rate? And
how could it be supposed that the products of
agriculture and industry, happening to be, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
very just re-action, (whether it originates with
the one or the other), increased in price in the
same proportion, agriculture and industry should
not be compelled to increase of course the price
of labour which procured those products? If
therefore you advance by 10 millions, the prices
either of all the productions of the earth, by
taxing agriculture, or of all the productions of
the arts, by taxing industry, you equally compel
the untaxed part to advance its prices to the
whole amount of the 10 millions laid on the
corresponding part, <i>otherwise goods to the amount
of 10 millions would evidently remain unsold</i>.
Now the influence of those new prices will
enforce by degrees an increase on the price
of labour, and this increase will soon be followed
by a fresh one on the value of its products;
whence it appears at last, that after all the
necessary re-actions, the same tax of 10 millions,
which by a general <i>equitable</i> poll-tax, supposed
<i>as equitable as it is <span class="smcap">impossible</span> to make it so</i>,
would only raise the prices by one twelfth, or
8⅓ <i>per cent.</i>; if laid, either on the land, or
luxury, or general consumption, would necessarily
advance the prices, sooner or later, to
25 <i>per cent.</i>; the very precise period whereat
every one would find himself in the exact
state in which he was previous to the tax, paying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
it is true, every thing 25 <i>per cent.</i> dearer, but
being himself paid 25 <i>per cent.</i> dearer too.</p>

<p>Alter the proportion of the usual price of
labour, by supposing a country so far barren as to
make it necessary to appropriate one half of the
revenue to the labouring people; in such case a
tax of 10 millions laid on a revenue of 60 would
increase by 30 <i>per cent.</i> the price of labour, and
of its products; 30 <i>per cent.</i> would raise the revenue
from 60 to 78 millions: now 39 being
the half of 78, as 30 is that of 60, the burden of
the tax would then prove equally <i>null</i>, after
every article should have been raised 30 <i>per
cent.</i></p>

<p>Alter again the proportion of the common price
of labour, by supposing that the cultivator is allowed
only one fourth of the revenue; this
division may take place in a country extremely
fertile; in this case, a tax of 10 millions on a
revenue of 60, would only add 20 <i>per cent.</i> to the
former prices; instead of raising the revenue of
60 millions to 75, as in the case of three equal
shares, or to 78, as in the supposition of the
revenue being divided in halves, the tax would
then carry it only to 72. Now the 4th part of
72 is 18, as 15 is the 4th of 60; therefore if,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
after the tax is imposed, you give 18 wherever
you paid only 15 before that period, the burden
will clearly be <i>null</i> again, since the increase in
the price of labour, must have followed the advanced
price of its products, an advance necessitated
by the impost.</p>

<p>Here, methinks, I hear the enthusiasts exclaim,
<i>How! the fertility of the land is then of
no advantage, but to its greedy owners!</i>—I am in
hopes that before I conclude this Pamphlet, I
shall be able to find, to the great satisfaction
of all good men, how many advantages remain
in the hands of the most opulent land proprietor;
nay I hope to prove that in a fertile
land there is nothing lost to any of its inhabitants,
unless <i>extraordinary efforts be used to concenter
within that spot the general benefit which must
result from it</i>. I shall content myself at present
with requesting the reader to compare my
thoughts on the taxes, with the two following
problems, so often debated both in <i>England</i>
and in <i>France</i>. How is it that <i>France</i> has constantly
retrieved her errors and her misfortunes?
How comes it that <i>England</i> has not yet sunk
under the burden of her taxes? The <i>French</i>
exciseman says: <i>It is because the more the people
are loaded, the better they walk</i>; and very sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
men in <i>England</i> used to say, “<i>Reason and experience</i>
seem to prove that taxes stimulate industry,
and that the poor, <i>to live as well as
before, perform more work without demanding
more for their labour</i>.” (<i>D. Hume</i>’s Essay
VIII. on Taxes). It seems to me that the above
two problems are more humanely solved by the
reasons I have produced, and that those reasons
destroy all idea of a miracle, or of the necessity
of loading the people in order to spur their industry,
and encourage them to work: on the
contrary, to forward those two great points, it
is necessary to increase the price of their labour in
the same proportion as that of its products is
raised by the taxes; and this will suffice to render
evidently <i>null</i> the burden of all taxes whatever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading33"><i>Further Considerations on the Necessity of a Correspondence
between the Prices of Agriculture
and those of Industry.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>I have said it more than once, and beg
leave to repeat it here: Let any essential object
be denoted by one number or another; it is a
matter of perfect indifference, provided the numbers
intended to denote the <i>mass</i> of objects corresponding
thereto, do not present any ideas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
contrary to the proportion of labour which exists
between the <i>essential object</i>, and the mass which
is to form its balance. Thus then, be the value
of wheat, which serves as the general standard,
because it is useful to all, at all times, and which
ought to be so, from another consideration almost
equally powerful, namely, that it constitutes
about one third of the landed revenue in <i>Europe</i>—be
its value, I say, denominated 30, 50, or 25,
nothing more indifferent, provided the numbers
denoting the value of the other products of land
and industry, keep exactly, either by more or
by less, within the same proportion; it is clear
that, in such a case, neither the land proprietor nor
the <i>capitalist</i> of industry, can undergo from the
alteration in the numbers, any real alteration in
their circumstances. But to think of nothing
but the manufactures, and imagine it possible to
maintain, and endeavour seriously to maintain,
wheat at the same price, whilst the taxes advance
by 10 <i>per cent.</i> that of the products of industry,—is
to aim at the ruin of agriculture, and to oblige
all the proprietors of land and money, whose
employments in the State would not indemnify
them for such an injustice, to go in search of
another country, where the manufacturer, better
acquainted with his real interest, would know,
or act as if he knew, that the solidity of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
wealth is inseparable from that of the land proprietor,
and from the ease of the proprietor of
money, and of the labouring man.</p>

<p><i>Then</i> perhaps those national manufacturers, so
proud and so jealous of their exportations, so
greedy of premiums, prohibitions, restrictions,
encouragements of all kinds, would sue more
ardently to have those nuisances suppressed, than
they ever did for their establishment.</p>

<p>Nothing more admirable than those regulations
to which <i>England</i> acknowledges to be indebted for
the best part of her wealth and power; but they
crept in at a time when ignorance generally prevailed,
when all the other parts of <i>Europe</i> had almost
no idea either of the principle of commerce, or of
its influence over all the other resources of society.
In effect, from what known point could one then
start, to imagine that a nation, who openly countenances
monopoly at home, in order to encourage
her foreign trade, lays the most solid basis
for the monopoly she wishes to secure to herself
every where? How was it possible to conceive
that the <i>Dutch</i>, a nation so necessary to those that
are deficient in means, and so forcibly compelled
by the superabundance of their own, to make
them serviceable to those who stand in need of
them, could not be shut out from the <i>English</i>
ports, without depriving the rest of <i>Europe</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
advantage, which their admittance every where
was necessarily calculated to procure to their correspondents,
by securing to them, <i>as well as to
England</i>, a competition so essential to all, and
fatal to monopoly alone? <i>Europe</i>, busy at that
time in search of another sort of equilibrium, did
not consider what weight commerce, carried on
upon such principles, would throw into one of the
scales; how could <i>Europe</i> then suspect that it
would overthrow the balance entirely? But what
is the final result of all these projects against
Nature?—The pretensions of the Ecclesiastical
State stirred up all <i>Europe</i>; <i>and the Pontifical
See was fixed in its proper place</i>. <i>France</i> roused
all <i>Europe</i> against the ambition of the House
of <i>Austria</i>, much more formidable by its real
power; <i>the Imperial Throne was fixed in its
proper place</i>, and <i>France</i> was hailed as the founder
and assertor of <i>European</i> liberties. Soon
after the Protectress became a despot; <i>England</i>
stirred up all <i>Europe</i> against her, and <i>France
was, aukwardly, thrown out of her proper place</i>;
<i>England</i>, the principal instrument of the revolution,
made an improper use of her importance,
as had been successively done by the Ecclesiastical
Power, the House of <i>Austria</i>, and by <i>France</i>;—the
Armed Neutrality appeared, and presented a
code of laws unheard of before; it was just; every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
nation, that had not bowed beneath the <i>English</i>
yoke, adopted it:—there was an instant, when
this armed neutrality might have dictated both
to <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>, laws as equitable as the
code itself; and all <i>Europe</i> would have applauded,
had even <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> united, at that very
instant, to exterminate in concert the whole naval
force of <i>Europe</i>, then burnt the exterminating
fleets, and themselves given to all the world those
very laws of equity which were intended to be
imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Every thing, at this moment, is in that happy
state, which gives time to reflect upon what is
past, to see what is present, to look forwards to
what is to come, and to consider an <i>ensemble</i>, the
very idea of which could not be admitted during
former periods. A few clouds, dispersed here
and there, do not spoil the beauty of the horizon;
no body can now, for any length of time, think
it his interest to ruin and destroy; and every
body is concerned not to suffer any thing to be
destroyed. I return to my subject, if I may be
said to have deviated from it.</p>

<p>If a diminution in the price of the necessaries
of life be looked upon as so very important, there
exists a sure method of effecting it, even in <i>England</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
without any detriment to the land proprietor.
Let us see whether this very method would
prove injurious to the true interest of the manufacturer,
who must be patronised, cherished as
the fountain head of riches; I mean that kind of
riches called <i>money</i>, which could not long subsist
without the riches called <i>wheat</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Fourteenth Hypothesis.</i></h3>

<p>Let us suppose, that, by the suppression of the
monopoly enjoyed by the manufacturers, and of
which they are so jealous, the price of the whole
of their goods should fall one tenth; in such a
case, the wheat which the new taxes will enhance
in price, I suppose, in the proportion of 40 to
44, would, upon a medium, fall back to 40; and
in this case again the produce of the manufactories
would only cost industry 20 instead of 22,
at which they will be rated when wheat shall
have risen from 40 to 44; for, in the latter supposition,
it will be necessary for industry to pay
finally this increase of expence, in favour of the
artificers, who would not long submit to an injustice,
without presenting <i>petitions</i> in their own
way: just as wheat must indispensably rise from
40 to 44, in order that the land and money-proprietors
be not compelled to leave their country,
to the great prejudice of the internal consumption,
so essential to the truest interest of the
manufacturer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>Let it then be supposed, that wheat should fall
from 44 to 40, and so of all the rest;—I confess
that the proprietor of money would thereby become
a gainer, and that the general persuasion is,
that it is salutary he should lose: but would he
long support his gain? Would not the encouragement
which every thing must derive from
this new order of things, from that activity
which trade would find in the new channels that
would open every day, when commerce should
build on that true principle, acknowledged to
be the only unerring one, <i>the exchange of commodities</i>,
(excepting the bullion required for the
five articles before mentioned)—would not that
activity, I say, that encouragement, inspire in
all parts of <i>Europe</i> an eagerness for labour, necessarily
followed by an increase of <i>real</i> wealth,
a creation of new productions, and by an increase
of that <i>imaginary</i> wealth, still more stimulating
than the former, because it is its proof and its
pledge, but which cannot be obtained without a
general increase in all the prices?</p>

<p>Will it be said, that, on the first moment, the
fall of prices would affect the intellects of those
who can only see, but never compare? that the
people, for instance, would lament their being
reduced to 10, from the 12 they had been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
for some days to receive, although
they should pay only 5 for what cost them 6
before? In this case, keep up the prices, but
without exception, and export on the true principles
of exportation: take for your guide the
example set up by my countryman, the <i>American</i>
of <i>Philadelphia</i>, in selling dearer because you are
compelled to do so; propose to buy dearer also,
and this will be only an act of justice; you will
see hereafter that you would at last be just, in
spite of yourselves; be so intentionally: you
cannot come down to the price of your purchasers;
raise their prices to a level with your
own, they will observe that even the first profit
is not the lot of the first bidder, if every one
doing justice to himself bids in proportion:
mean while, the eagerness for labour goes on
increasing, and by little and little the benefit
extends to the lowest wretch that dwells in the
community; he finds more work to do, and a
greater reward for it.</p>

<p>It will be said no doubt, that this is another
supposition of a general agreement.—No, certainly
not; it is enough for every one to see that it
must be so; that it will happen without any other
help than the private interest of each individual;
that these private and niggardly measures, already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
taken, or to be taken, in order to prevent the
result of all those personal interests, are of no use
but to keep justice at a distance; to multiply the
number of injuries which daily take place, till
what must be, comes to pass; to produce a greater
evil, where it might be less; to substitute <i>forced</i>,
to <i>necessary</i> prices: but it is so evident that wheat,
and all the productions of the earth, should increase
by one tenth, as soon as the taxes, or an
accession of wealth, shall increase by one tenth
the price of the products of industry, that it is
necessary to lay this principle as the basis of all
regulations, <i>or else openly to adopt as a maxim, that
agriculture should be sacrificed to industry</i>.</p>

<p>This maxim, I set forth of the correspondence
required between the prices, together with the
inconvenience of having them too much out of
proportion with those of other nations, militates,
it is true, against that monstrous system of prohibitions,
corporations, &amp;c. which is the only
burden entailed upon us by our forefathers, <i>the
only burden</i> which the present legislatures can
transmit to posterity; but although it might be
an absurdity to suppose a reform as sudden as it
would be advantageous, yet would it be less
absurd to suppose that, the evil being once found
out, the remedy will constantly be rejected?
Would it be less absurd to suppose, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
manufacturers, better acquainted with their real
interests, will persist in endeavouring to aggravate
the evil, instead of complying with the only
means of retrieving it? Would it be less absurd
to suppose, that each of them will never
perceive that he pays for the privilege of ransoming
in his branch of industry, by the disadvantage
of being himself ransomed on a thousand
other objects? <i>Russia</i>, 30 years ago, was perhaps
more distant from her present state, than
the unmasking of monopoly, and the knowledge
of its effects, will be from its extirpation.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading34"><i>On a Cause little suspected of high Prices.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>I am not ashamed to own the prejudice I
entertain against a diminution in the price of any
thing whatever, when I observe that discouragement,
at least in the part affected, would be the
consequence of such a diminution; whilst, on the
contrary, a gradual, general, and proportioned advance
in the prices of every thing, is constantly
followed by a greater activity in all the branches of
labour, which really increases the quantity of its
productions, in a proportion far superior to the
advance on that imaginary, <i>nominal</i> value, acquired
by fermentation; my intention, therefore,
cannot be to declaim against one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
potent causes of the high prices prevailing in
<i>England</i>, and which nobody, I think, has yet
mentioned. This last expression shews, that I
do not mean here, that quantity of paper-money,
to which many people, in more than one kingdom,
ascribe all the evil, of which the sole real
part is the work of monopoly. I think I have
proved, that it is impossible there should long
remain in circulation any paper above the necessary
quantity: all would flock to the Bank to
be paid in cash, had not the Bank enough of it
to discharge her notes, when presented, with such
readiness as to leave no doubt of the validity of
those other notes, which, in the natural course of
things, would not be presented there to be paid
in money. The Bank would derive very little
advantage from the momentary cheat of paying
off large sums in sixpences; this legerdemain is
admirable, but can suffice only to correspond to
the wanton tricks sometimes played by great
politicians, to give the Bank a momentary trouble.
It is, <i>then</i>, necessary to rock those children,
whom great men make it their amusement to scare;
and they must be rocked till they are fast asleep,
or till the great men are tired of making faces
at them. After the farce is over, the children
wake, and do not even remember to have been
frightened; money is found wherever it is necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and every thing returns to that order which
it is every one’s interest to maintain.</p>

<p>What then is that other cause, so active, so
cogent, not of that extravagant price which monopoly
alone can occasion, but of that price rather
above the <i>necessary</i> one, which gives to every
thing an increase of vigour? It is credit. It is
that prodigious talisman which realises all that it
conceives, since all that it conceives has the
same advantage as reality. How many capitals
would never have existed, had not credit supposed
them several years before they did really
exist? How fill up the real chasm of capitals,
which may, in an instant, suspend a hundred
manufactories in a kingdom, and, by that suspension,
ruin, starve, the trader, the merchant,
the manufacturer, the mechanic, all, except the
farmer, whether proprietor or tenant, who, by
the counter-blow, could not die of hunger, but in
real misery on his stacks of wheat, which he
would no longer attempt to reproduce.</p>

<p>That man is ignorant of his own value, who,
pen in hand, weighs, calculates, measures time,
distances, expenditure, obstacles, facilities, occurrences;
and whose signature, on account of
the supposed exactness of his combinations, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
soon after produce, at two or three hundred
leagues distance, and in fifty places on the road,
the same effect which would have resulted from
the real possession of the object of which this
signature is the pledge. If he shares with all
those whom he makes easy, re-animates, or puts
in action, the benefit which they derive from the
speed, as well as from the supposed certainty of
his operations, undoubtedly no one will dispute
his title to the reward; and yet we shall see presently,
that this medal is not without its reverse,
<i>supposing an advance in prices to be an inconvenience</i>.</p>

<p>I shall apply the principle to a fact very well
known in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1762, about 2000<i>l.</i> sterling, carried
to the island of <i>Grenada</i>, was there received
with that veneration due to gold when we have
been years without seeing any, and have not yet
forgot its virtues.</p>

<p>The above sum regulated the markets; coffee
was set up at eight or ten pence <i>per</i> pound;
sugars sold <i>per</i> quintal thirty or forty shillings
currency; the inhabitants were in perfect ecstacy:
I shall say nothing of the device practised in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
order to <i>hook in</i>, by means of those 2000<i>l.</i> about
thirty times the value of that sum, and yet satisfy
every body: that is foreign to my subject; but
I will say, with pleasure, that an honest gentleman,
moved at the distressed situation of another
who was dunned by merciless creditors, gave him
in hard cash a trifling part of the sum he wanted,
and for the remainder furnished him with his
own bills of exchange on <i>London</i>, assuring him
that those to whom they might be presented
would take them for cash without any demur.
Those bills had fully the promised effect; the
same gentleman obliged several other persons;
the benefactor soon met with competitors, all
difficulties disappeared by means of scraps of
paper on <i>London</i>, and the debtor who, on the
landing of the precious metal, had deemed himself
too lucky to sell his coffee at ten-pence and
his sugar at 40 shillings, now offered impudently
his bill on <i>London</i>, indorsed by some patron, if
a creditor refused to give him 45 shillings for his
sugar, and twelve-pence for his coffee.</p>

<p>Gold, attracted by the first homage paid to it,
came in plenty, and fell in value by the establishment
of credit; it afterwards took another course,
and went, no doubt, somewhere else to supply the
want of credit, and pave the way to it. From that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
moment very little money came to <i>Grenada</i>,
and no one ever wished for more; but then the
price of commodities was advanced, and the
readiness with which goods, to the amount of
several thousand pounds sterling, were delivered
to such a planter as, six months before,
would not have presumed to demand the sixth
part of them, did not permit him to start any
objection against the prices set on the goods he
stood in need of, when he thought himself indemnified
for the excess in those prices, by that
at which his were rated, <i>and by the time granted
him to make good his payments</i>. The <i>Grenadians</i>
abused this credit, as they did in <i>Scotland</i>, and
unfortunately at the same period. But this
is not the matter in point; the present object is,
that the establishment of credit in <i>Grenada</i> enhanced
the price of every thing there, and that
the encouragement and activity resulting from
that increase doubled, in the space of six years,
the real quantity of the products in that colony,
whilst credit had, in the end, increased its nominal
value hardly one tenth. In 1764 the
exports of <i>Grenada</i> amounted to 206,889<i>l.</i>;
in 1770, they were at 433,421<i>l.</i>; two years
after, they rose as high as 492,974<i>l.</i>: it may be
added, that in <i>England</i>, thanks to the extension
of that miracle wrought by credit, the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
arising from those new products, and the necessity
of furnishing the balance thereof in merchandise,
propagated, if I may be allowed the expression,
from county to county, the necessary means of
<i>consuming</i>, that is to say, of <i>realising</i>, that augmentation
of wealth, whose price was constantly kept
up by the additional consumption of all kinds
which followed it: such is the usual chain.</p>

<p>In effect, do but observe how easily a creditable
merchant buys from the manufacturer, payable
at twelve months, an enormous stock of
goods, which he is himself obliged to sell, either
to the consumer or to the retailer, at twelve,
eighteen, or twenty-four months credit, and
which often are not totally paid for at the end of
three years. What difference in the prices must
be the consequence of that series of <i>facilities</i>!
Are high prices an evil? Put an end to credit,
nothing more easy; nothing more is required,
than to suffer to lie dormant all those
laws, which secure to the creditor, the payment
of his advances at the precise time when they
become demandable: it is that certitude of being
repaid, at the needful hour, that often induces
the creditor himself to borrow, in order to
extricate a debtor, whom he knows to be indiscreet,
but from whose custom he derives a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
yearly profit, upon a prodigious consumption;
a profit he would lose, by being less
indulgent: take away from the creditor the certainty
of extorting his repayment, if it should
be refused at a moment when a critical event
should render such rigour indispensable, credit is
destroyed, <i>as well as</i> the consumption which
followed it, <i>as well as</i> the production of the earth
which could not be paid, but by those manufactories
annihilated by the want of consumption:
cross the Straits of <i>Calais</i>, and (in order to console
the <i>worshippers of the balance</i>) add, <i>as
well as</i> thousands of acres of vineyards in <i>France</i>,
the produce of which <i>strips England</i> annually of
so vast a sum! <i>as well as</i> thousands of acres in
<i>Italy</i>, set apart for the rearing of silk-worms, and
the culture of olive-trees, which swallow up a
prodigious sum of <i>English</i> money; <i>as well as</i>
thousands of acres in <i>Silesia</i>, where they cultivate
the hemp which <i>English</i> money buys in that
country; <i>as well as</i> thousands of acres in <i>Russia</i>
and in <i>Sweden</i>, whence we are obliged to import,
at the expence of so much <i>English</i> money, that
immense quantity of timber, iron, canvass—articles
which would become useless by the extinction
of credit, and the destruction of that trade,
of which credit was the very soul;—the chain
would lead us too far. It is sufficiently evident,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
that then all the goods remaining unsold could
not be purchased but with ready money, and
<i>then</i> indeed every thing would be excessively
cheap. Would all that be for the best?—In a
word, give up all thoughts of riches, or submit
to the highest prices; but let those high prices
come to you from the profusion of wealth universally
diffused, and not from the tyranny of
your own monopoly.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading35"><i>The happy Issue of a desperate Combat between
Monopoly and some private Interests.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The scene of this combat does not lie in
<i>England</i>; we have seen that there they think of
nothing more than to keep the balance even, and
make up, as fast as possible, each in his own
department, for the injustice granted to the importunity
and cupidity of others, without any
other inconvenience arising therefrom, than that of
having a very large surplus, excessively dear, and
that of not being able to procure what is wanted
at the lowest rate, nor of the best quality. Even
Smuggling, which follows certain regulations,
with bludgeons and pistols in hand, cannot produce
any great effect on the sum of national labour,
though it may perhaps considerably influence
the revenue of the Exchequer; it is probable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
that the smuggler exports as much <i>English</i> work
into <i>France</i> as he imports of <i>French</i> work into
<i>England</i>; and that, in this respect, the gain of the
most fortunate individual comes to very little: my
intention is, to speak here of a combat, which has
lasted a hundred years between the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap">fair</span>
trader and the <i>American</i> smuggler.</p>

<p>The system of administration adopted under
Mons. <i>Sartine</i>, for the <i>French</i> colonies, a system,
for which they are indebted to ten years labour
of Mr. <i>Malouit</i>, the present Intendant of
<i>Toulon</i>, permits us to speak now of that combat,
and to descry the dawn of a more serene day,
opening upon those colonies; till then, I should
not have hesitated to call them unfortunate, <i>in regard
to their means</i>, if the private interest of the
inhabitants, as well as that of the general-officers,
Intendants and Directors of the Domain,
(interests never combined but amongst the latter)
had not moderated the effects of that dreadful
punishment the galleys, denounced at the request
of the <i>French</i> merchants, against any one who
should presume to import a negro or a cheese
from the <i>English</i> islands into the <i>French</i> colonies,
however good the one, however industrious the
other might be; and whatever advantage might
be gained by paying for both in molasses which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
the planter was obliged to throw away, <i>because
the French merchants would not buy it</i>.</p>

<p>It is true, that the humanity of the <i>great</i>
smugglers has often suffered the <i>little</i> ones to
escape, before or after sentence, (the negro and
the cheese being duly seised); and that a dozen of
the little smugglers whom the policy of the great
ones sacrificed <i>by installments</i> to the clamours of
the merchant, were nearly the only victims of
that barbarous law, the strict execution of which
would have deprived <i>France</i>,</p>

<p>First, Of the fifth part, at least, of the present
revenue arising to her from her colonies;</p>

<p>Secondly, Of all those branches of industry to
which such an addition of revenue gives constant
life;</p>

<p>Thirdly, Of all the profit which the <i>fair</i>
trader, the instigator of that barbarous law, gets
annually on the importations and exportations
which that additional income requires;</p>

<p>Fourthly, Of the duties which the King’s
treasury receives directly, or indirectly, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
the one and the other; (it is impossible to
estimate this article.)</p>

<p>Fifthly, and in fine, of the assistance which the
State derives for the Royal navy, from that increase
in its trading one, which became necessary
after the increase of a revenue, due to people
who should have been sent to the galleys, had
they been caught in the flagrancy of such a
crime. One half of the cotton and coffee which
is gathered at <i>St. Domingo</i>, <i>Martinico</i>, <i>Guadaloupe</i>,
and <i>Grand Terre</i> above all, owes its
existence to negroes, constantly furnished to
the <i>French</i> smuggler, both great and small,
by the <i>English</i> merchant, the natural, <i>and as it
plainly appears</i>, the necessary enemy to <i>France</i>
and her trade; the quantity of sugar and indigo
which in the said colonies owes its existence to
the same means, is much more than necessary
to make up that fifth of the revenue, the glory of
which may be claimed by the smuggler, though
the <i>fair</i> trader comes in for a share in the
profits.</p>

<p>Any one desirous to have this fact confirmed,
may be informed of it by nine tenths of the
<i>French</i> planters, provided they be taught that
the time is now come, when every useful truth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
may be spoken, even with energy, when accompanied
by decency. This once ascertained,
he is no native of <i>America</i> who will refuse his
evidence; an <i>American</i> believes in every thing
that is just and reasonable, the very instant
that it is pronounced.</p>

<p>I sincerely wish that smuggling might produce
in <i>England</i> the same good it has done to the
<i>French</i> colonies; this would appear to me very
just, and the more so, since it will not be the
fault of the <i>British</i> commerce, if that blessed
contraband, after having given life to <i>America</i>,
does not spread the same animation every
where, <i>Great Britain excepted</i>. I have heard
an <i>English</i> manufacturer prove at the bar of
the House of Lords, that his manufactory
was in want of a special patronage, by so much
the more, as the size and brittleness of his ware
made it a difficult point for him to smuggle it
over to the continent, and as a duty of 30 <i>per
cent.</i> had been lately laid upon it, in the two
countries where it concerned him most to have it
exported. Amongst other questions that were
put to him, I remarked four, which would have
stunned me, had I been in his place. One of
these questions was as follows: “Have you
not heard that that 30 <i>per cent.</i> of which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
complain, was laid in consequence of some
prohibitions, or extra duties imposed in <i>England</i>
on some articles imported from those
very countries which you allude to?” I could
make nothing of the manufacturer’s answers;
they were so long-winded, they had been so
carefully studied, they were so very full of a policy
which I do not understand, that it became
impossible for me to class them under any heads
in my memory.</p>

</div>

<p>A General maxim, almost universally adopted
beyond contradiction, and the foundation of an
hundred regulations, enforced from pole to
pole, is, that it is essential for all national commodities
to be at the lowest price, in order that
foreign trade may turn out to the best advantage;
that is to say, for the native traders to be able to
dispose abroad of the products of national industry,
at a cheaper rate than any other nation
can sell those of her own. Certain it is, that the
less price national commodities will bring, the
less of the products of national industry will be
necessary to pay them off, the more of course
will there remain of those products to stock the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
foreign markets, and the more also will the
foreign purchaser be gratified by the reduced
price at which they may be given, to the detriment
of the land proprietor of the nation; this
is so self-evident that it cannot be withstood.
This, methinks, is carrying to an excess the
principles of Christian charity, if the Legislators
are land proprietors; it is a shameful abuse of
power, if the Legislators are at the head of manufactures;
and in either case one must be blind
to the necessity of keeping up an even balance
between agriculture and industry.—<i>Had not
Nature militated under hand, and with some advantage
against the dreams of speculators in this
respect, and against the much more dangerous surreptions
of cupidity, to what state of abjection and
misery would not agriculture be now reduced in all
countries!</i></p>

<p>I have said, that the price of every thing would
perhaps be now in <i>France</i>, very little different
from what it was 40 years ago, had it not been
for an eventual circumstance, (I might have said
a regulation,) which a few years ago tertiated,
at least, the fortune of every subject in that
kingdom;—nominally at first, it is true; but
afterwards in reality, owing to the prodigious
encouragement that ensued; I mean the regulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
which permitted the exportation of wheat,
and authorised each of the <i>French</i> Provinces not
to consider herself as a stranger to all the others.
I shall only make a few reflexions on a matter
which might furnish enough to fill a volume.</p>

<p>First, The adopted maxim of the pretended
advantage of enjoying the national commodities
at the lowest prices, <i>for the better encouragement
of industry</i>, was not held less sacred at the time
the regulation took place, than when that maxim
was considered as the basis of the system of exportation
<i>the most advantageous to the kingdom</i>,
and the condition (<i>sine quâ non</i>) of the many
wonders that might be expected therefrom,
towards an increase of wealth.⸺Yet if there
exist a regulation calculated to operate in diametrical
opposition to the <i>sacred maxim</i>, it is clearly
the freedom of the corn trade; to be convinced
of this truth, one need but attend to its effect in
<i>France</i>. The little success I have met with in
my endeavours to come, in this respect, at some
particulars which might perhaps have given me
a few ideas, confines me to what I can gather
from recollection; but with truth I can say
that my memory seldom deceives me on the
abstracts it presents to my mind. The reader
may perceive, that the summary I now stand in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
need of, has no manner of connexion with the
little springs that were put in play to ruin the
author of the scheme; the chief and true point,
is, that all secret intrigues, all public combinations,
ended only in occasioning a reform in
what was deemed abusive, in a regulation the
advantages of which were fully demonstrated;
and that the price of wheat, after having tertiated,
doubled, trebled perhaps by the help of
the forestallers, from whose abilities were expected
the repeal of the law and the fall of its
devisers, was fixed at last between one half and
three fourths above the price, as it was upon the
medium of ten years preceding the regulation.
It is easily conceived that the price of wheat
dictated that of all other commodities; in effect,
previous to the last war, the only decisive period
in the present point, the nominal revenue of the
lands in <i>France</i>, increased by one half at least
of what it was 15 years before;—then, commodities
were, upon the whole, dearer by one
half; yet the maxim was held <i>sacred</i> still, and is
not less so at the present time—in <i>England</i> as
well as in <i>France</i>;—nevertheless I can see no
medium; either the maxim is absurd in itself, or
<i>French</i> industry has lost one third of its benefits
by a regulation which tertiated, almost suddenly,
the price of all productions in <i>France</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, In order that industry may be said
to have lost that third, the increase of revenue,
yielded by the land to its proprietor, must have
been cast into some national <i>vortex</i>, or sent into
some foreign one, or concealed in the earth by
the suspicious proprietor; for if the surplus of
the landed revenue has occasioned a greater demand
for and consumption of the products of industry,
and more culture of the land, industry,
by raising the price of her goods on the very first
increase of the demand, has obtained in the first
year, her first share in that accession of wealth;
and she could not miss the second, so soon as a
larger sum of savings bestowed upon the lands,
had brought about what they never fail to produce,
I mean, more productions, and soon after
a greater demand for goods, and <i>soon after</i> again
more goods to answer the additional demands.</p>

<p>Thirdly, If that sudden advance in the price
of provisions, ended only in an increase almost
equally sudden in the price of the products of industry,
there could not be then any inconvenience,
either to industry or agriculture, in a
sudden and proportionate rise which preserved
the former equilibrium, and presented the same
correspondence between the two revenues; (the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
only thing that can materially affect the two
<i>capitalists</i>, though neither of them think about
it.)</p>

<p>Fourthly, If there has been no inconvenience
in so considerable but proportionable increase in
the prices, <i>coming from agriculture</i>, where could
be the inconvenience in a proportioned increase,
equally sudden and general if <i>it should
come</i> from industry?</p>

<p>Fifthly, What difference can there be between
a regulation which raises the landed revenue in
a kingdom, from 6 to 9, followed by a re-action
in industry, which raises equally to 9 what
usually went for 6; and another regulation which
would begin the same operation in industry, and
should be equally followed by a proportionable
re-action in agriculture?</p>

<p>Sixthly, When, by a regulation respecting
the corn, industry is at liberty to enhance the
price of her goods, in the same proportion as the
effects of the regulation have raised the products
of agriculture, cannot a regulation that concerns
or imposes taxes, and by which industry is
forced to increase her prices by the full amount
of the taxes,—cannot such a regulation, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
permit the cultivator, without inconvenience, to
advance the price of the productions of the
earth, in the same proportion as the taxes, or the
regulation concerning them, have increased that
of the products of industry?</p>

<p>Seventhly, Let us suppose that the operation
is effected, and followed by the sum of money
which a nominal revenue, grown more considerable,
requires for the circulation; can there
exist then the most trifling difference between the
present state of any individuals in the nation,
and the state they were in previous to their being
loaded with that enormous burden, called
taxes?</p>

<p>Eighthly, If after enquiry, the only answer
that could be given should be a negative, would
it not be profitable to let the public into the
secret, in order that after having observed a
very singular analogy between a young nymph
loaded with a column of several thousand pounds
weight of air, each of them as heavy as if it were
of lead, and the <i>French</i> as well as the <i>English</i>
loaded annually, constantly, in the same manner,
the one with 600 millions of <i>livres Tournois</i>,
the other with 14 or 15 millions of pounds sterling,
they should be led further to observe, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
what agility, what graces, what sprightliness, the
young dancer plays with her load—“trips it
along on the fantastic toe,” and with what
grimaces, what groans, what lamentations, the
two vigorous nations shrink under a burden
which is not more sensible than air, from the
instant that it is as perfectly divided?</p>

<p>I must here go some steps back:</p>

<p>Ninthly, If the nullity of the burden depended
on the equality with which it should be divided,
and if this equality should depend on an addition
to the supposed burden, might it not be
expected (not from the tricks of customary seduction,
or from the shorter method of authority,
but from all the means calculated to enforce
conviction) that the nation would find herself
less aggrieved by an additional tax, which would
tend to equalise the weight, than she could be by
an increase of taxes laid for the purpose of effecting
a reimbursement, which, upon a second
thought, no one can wish for?</p>

<p>Tenthly, Before the regulation alluded to,
wheat was, in <i>France</i>, one third or one half
cheaper than it is at this day; the rest of the
other productions of the earth stood in the same
proportion: in <i>England</i>, at that very time, the
price of wheat differed very little from what it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
now is. How could <i>England then</i> maintain a
competition—a combat, as it were, of exportation,
against her <i>natural</i> enemy (the <i>French</i> industry),
so lightly, so advantageously armed by
the low price of the commodities in <i>France</i>?—If
the maxim is as just as it is held <i>sacred</i>, surely
<i>France</i> must have derived a prodigious benefit
from the barricadoes by which the exportation of
wheat was prevented, even from one Province
to another, in order that it should be in all at
the lowest possible price:—it follows also that
<i>England</i>, already compelled by her taxes, her
internal monopoly, and her riches, to raise the
price of her wheat at home, must have undergone
dreadful inconveniences, by availing herself,
as she has ever done, of the least dearth
abroad, to make that very wheat dearer in <i>England</i>,
whilst she was going to diminish its price
wherever scarcity had made it excessive.</p>

<p>Eleventhly, If <i>France</i> has obtained such wonderful
advantages from her internal as well as
external barriers, it is not in respect to her agriculture;
her agriculture has clearly lost, not only
that part of the value in her productions, of
which she was daily deprived by this barrier, but
also the encouragement which a gradual increase
in the price of the productions would have occasioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
to increase their quantity: it is therefore
by the exportation of the products of her
industry, which, being sold at a price below
that of all other nations, have procured her in
money that prodigious balance of exported goods,
<i>which the wretched state of the national cultivator
did not permit him to pay for</i>:—but observe,
that the <i>French</i> exportation, carried on with that
advantage (pretended to be so very considerable)
of the low price of national commodities,
brought no more money to <i>France</i>, than that
which she wanted for the five articles I have
mentioned before, when treating of the balance
of <i>England</i>. This matter I hope I shall set in
the fullest blaze of evidence.—But, on the other
hand, observe also that <i>England</i>, by an exportation
carried on with the utmost regularity, under
the supposed disadvantage of her commodities
being rated much higher than those of her
competitors, a rate which she even increased
herself, by the exportation of wheat, which she
encouraged by premiums—<i>by premiums, destructive
of the sacred maxim</i>; observe, I say, that
under that disadvantage, in spite of those inconsistencies,
as fortunate as they are real and palpable,
<i>England</i>, nevertheless, has not failed to
procure the money wanted for the five articles,
the only ones that can give any value to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
money.—Shall it be said that <i>France</i> would have
obtained a balance in money much less considerable,
if she had not kept her prices so low, if
she had acted with less respect to the maxim?—Shall
it be said, that the balance in money would
have been far more favourable to <i>England</i>, had
not the price of her commodities been so high at
home; if she had more consistently acted upon the
maxim; if, above all, she had prohibited the
exportation of wheat, which is so often lamented,
and even sometimes so loudly complained of by
her manufacturers?—This indeed would be to
appropriate great merit to the resource of hiding
money under ground, when we cannot flatter ourselves
with the thoughts of having too much of it,
but at the expence of agriculture: but no matter;
let us see whether the inference be just.</p>

<p>Twelfthly, Had <i>France</i> been indebted to the
disparagement in the prices of her commodities,
for the advantage of procuring the money wanted
for the five articles before mentioned, she would
have found herself in the impossibility of answering
that want, as soon as, by the new regulation,
those commodities were restored to their
natural value, as soon as the liberty of exporting
wheat had raised its price almost to the
level of that which it bore in <i>England</i>.—Now
will it be said, that ever since the landed revenue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
in <i>France</i> has risen from 40 to 50 <i>per cent.</i> by an
advance in the price of commodities, less bullion
has been spent by the <i>French</i> in plate, in gilding,
and other articles of luxury?—Will it be said that
<i>France</i> stood in need of the money necessary to
settle in cash with her foreign correspondents,
when this resource from circumstances became
preferable to the mode of paying in bills of exchange?—Will
it be said that she fell short of
it for all those Jewish and miserable operations,
or for that reciprocally beneficial smuggling with
her neighbours?—Will it be said, that her circulation,
which, beyond any doubt, required a
more considerable mass of money, as soon as her
revenue had tertiated, has suffered by that necessity
of a higher balance, become impossible
(according to the maxim) as soon as it grew indispensable?—Will
it be said, that her industry
has lingered away as soon as her agriculture
has been more able to enliven it?—Yet all
these absurdities must be admitted, or it must
be acknowledged that the price of commodities
may be tertiated, or doubled in a nation, not
only without injuring industry, whose business it
is to keep within the kingdom all the money
wanted for circulation, but even with securing to
the nation a more considerable balance in money,
since it must become so whenever the price of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
every thing is raised one third, and perhaps more
than one half.—The <i>sacred maxim</i> therefore has
not even common sense, <i>when applied to the internal
trade of the State</i>.</p>

<p>Thirteenthly, If <i>France</i>, who has not the assistance
of paper-money, did actually procure so
clearly to herself an annual balance more considerable
in money, as soon as she had tertiated
her revenue, it follows that <i>England</i> must, really,
have experienced a competition much more disagreeable,
from that very circumstance from
which, <i>according to the maxim</i>, she had less reason
to fear it; for whilst the price of commodities
was below <i>par</i> in <i>France</i>, it is clear that
having no <i>national vortex</i>, she required less money
for the circulation of a revenue of 100 than
for one of 150: it was therefore more to the advantage
of <i>England</i>, <i>in spite of the maxim</i>, that
the commodities should be at a low price in
<i>France</i>, than to have them raised 50 <i>per cent.</i>
The <i>sacred maxim</i> then is destitute of common
sense, <i>when applied to foreign trade, to the competition
abroad</i>.</p>

<p>Fourteenthly, But if the circumstance which
drove <i>France</i> to the necessity of acquiring a
greater balance in real cash, stood at a very small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
distance from another circumstance by which
<i>England</i> was compelled to procure one still more
considerable, for a general re-coining of her
guineas; and if <i>France</i> and <i>England</i> have done
each other no material injury in this kind of
competition, (this is proved by the fact, since
both nations have equally and certainly, ever
since, procured the annual balance which they
wanted); may it not be fairly concluded, that
<i>England</i> has been no loser, by a revolution in the
price of wheat, which enriched <i>France</i> by tertiating
her revenue, and forced her to receive
annually, in cash, a balance far greater than she
did previous to that revolution?</p>

<p>Fifteenthly, Now if <i>England</i>, since the revolution
in the <i>French</i> prices, has obtained as much
bullion as she wished for, or rather all that which
she could lay out on the five articles of her common
expenditure, and for the additional circumstance
of a re-coinage, whilst on the other hand
<i>France</i> had all her wants supplied with the greater
ease, may it not be inferred that <i>England</i> could
have gained nothing, even upon the supposition
that the annual supply of money, become necessary
to <i>France</i>, had been less considerable, that
is to say, even if the <i>French</i> commodities had remained
in their former state of disparagement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>Sixteenthly, If that increase of prices in the
landed revenue has not been restrained to <i>France</i>;
if it be a fact, as all travellers pretend to have
observed, that all the other parts of <i>Europe</i>
have experienced the same revolution, the same
encouragement, the same success, except the
difference produced in some places by the singularity
of certain laws; may it not be concluded,
that although <i>England</i> has lost nothing by the
revolution, although <i>France</i> has proved a gainer
by it, other nations have also enriched themselves,
namely, one tenth, those where the prices
have been advanced a tenth; a ninth, those
where the prices have been raised one quarter;
one half, those where the prices have risen one
half, &amp;c. independently of an increase still more
essential, <i>viz.</i> that of the quantity of the productions
of the earth, <i>which always closely follows
that of their prices</i>.</p>

<p>Seventeenthly, Were one to reflect, that this
increase in the prices, in regard to the productions
of the earth, is always followed by a similar
increase with respect to the products of industry,
which thereby receives the same encouragement;
if, after examination, no one can harbour
any doubt of the fact; would it be an easy
matter, even with the help of the <i>sacred maxim</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
to persuade any nation, whose prices have been
doubled, to reduce the nominal of her revenue
from 20 to 18, in order to get the advantage in
the competition with another nation who, by
some disagreeable circumstances, should have
been obliged to raise her products from 20 to 22,
as <i>England</i> is compelled to do? Would not
one, on the contrary, conjecture that every wise
nation will follow the advice of the <i>American</i> of
<i>Philadelphia</i>, <i>i. e.</i> that she will not hesitate to
raise equally her own products from 20 to 22,
certain, as she will be by this means, to give fresh
encouragement both to her agriculture and her
industry, and not to hurt in the least the interest
of the nation whom those disagreeable
circumstances should have compelled that rise
from 20 to 22; compelled, I say, without procuring
for her that encouragement which cannot
spring from such a rise, <i>but in as much as it is
not necessitated by taxes</i>?</p>

<p>Eighteenthly, Is it not even probable that
every wise nation will be sensible that there is
but one way to carry on, without being constantly
duped, a commerce with another nation, obliged
to raise the price of her goods; <i>viz.</i> to raise, in
the same proportion, those which are given in
exchange?—This, some will say, is an indirect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
advice which I take upon me to give to industry;
nothing more useless, will they add; industry in
all countries never fails making that calculation.—I
do not assume the liberty of advising
industry;—Industry is far better acquainted,
than I am, with her own interest: it is to agriculture
I presume to give advice; and this I
have an incontestable right to do, since I myself
am a cultivator, an <i>American</i> cultivator, and
that my fortune cannot increase, nor even stand
as it is, but with that of my brethren, the cultivators
throughout all <i>Europe</i>, whose consumption
is as essential to me, in regard to sugars,
cottons, coffee, indigo, &amp;c. as mine is essential
to them, with respect to wines, flour, oils,
hemp, iron, &amp;c. How is it possible to charge
them with an advanced price on the goods they
purchase, without diminishing their means of
buying, <i>unless they raise their own commodities
equally with the above goods</i>?—How can one
diminish their power of buying, without diminishing
also my resources for a sale?—How can
one diminish my resources for a sale, without
diminishing my means of production?—And
how is it possible to put a stop to the productions
of <i>America</i>, without crushing in the very
bud all the <i>European</i> productions, <i>which are to
pay for them</i>?—There is not the least doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
but that, between merchant and merchant, alien
or native, there never is any difficulty: nothing
more candid than their respective conduct; never
a word about prices; each fixes his own, and it
often happens that a bale of goods has been sold
ten times upon the invoice, and never opened:—But
when a merchant, no matter of what nation,
says to his customer, no matter of what
country; <i>English goods have increased in price
from 20 to 22, I cannot have them for less</i>; it is
essential for every land proprietor, from Pole to
Pole, to know that he must not hesitate to
answer: <i>You cannot come down to me, give me
leave to get up to you</i>; or, in other words, <i>I
also advance my prices from 20 to 22, so that
every thing is in its due order, and the cock of the
balance stands still in its place</i>. On this principle,
clearly evident and of an irrefragable necessity,
I maintain that it is <i>England</i>, successively compelled,
as well by her wealth, as by her taxes
and monopoly, to increase her prices at home,—<i>England</i>,
trading to all parts of <i>Europe</i>, more
largely than any other country,—it is <i>England</i>, I
say, who, to this day, has raised the prices of
every thing all over <i>Europe</i>; and I insist, that
<i>England</i>, once more obliged to carry those prices
still higher, once more will compel <i>Europe</i> to
follow her example, and that all <i>Europe</i> will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
grow richer by her means, (as has been the case
hitherto) on account of the encouragement
which this increase will give in all countries,
where <i>England</i> may think fit to continue or extend
her trade on fair and equitable principles.</p>

<p>It is certain, that one cannot, without some
reflexion, comprehend that chain composed of
so many incoherent, so widely distant links, that
union, that mutual dependance of interests, in
appearance so opposite to each other; and that,
even with the assistance of a few <i>hypotheses</i> sufficient
to give an idea of the whole, the only confession
subscribed to by the reader, will be, that
they imply no palpable contradiction, but that
they are nevertheless the mere offspring of imagination,
and ought to be ranked amongst
non-entities. Yet the two <i>hypotheses</i> of which
<i>Rome</i> seemed to be the subject, were no more, if
we except the paper-currency, than the type of
the revolution which took place in <i>France</i> at
the time of the regulation I have spoken of,—a
regulation, which in less than two years increased
the wealth of that nation from 16 to 24, 50 <i>per
cent.</i>; as if the <i>French</i> had been at last made
sensible, that <i>England</i> could not work for herself
without working for them, and that consequently
they had a right to say with my <i>Roman</i>: <i><span class="upright">England</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
is rich to the amount of 24, only because she denominates
24 that same quantity of wheat which our barricadoes
and barriers have obliged us to call only 16
in our country; the only thing to be done therefore,
is to set fire to our barricadoes, and break down our
barriers, that henceforth the same 16 may be denominated
24, and all at once we shall be in fact as
rich as <span class="upright">England</span>, without having been so judiciously
at work.</i></p>

<p>Another advantage that would accrue from
that uniformity, nearly general, in all prices, if
one would lend an helping hand to Nature,
after having been convinced of the impossibility
of reaping any other benefit from the obstacles
thrown in her way, but the sad advantage
of retarding her progress;—another advantage,
I say, that would accrue from that kind of
uniformity in prices, which undergoes no alteration,
but from the wants and demands, is,
that all that monstrous system of prohibitions or
equivalent restrictions, must crumble of itself:
for, with what face could a national manufacturer
solicit the means and privilege of making his own
countrymen pay 10 <i>per cent.</i> dearer for those
goods, which another nation tenders to them at
10 <i>per cent.</i> cheaper, notwithstanding the expence
of exportation? What reasons could he urge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
when, instead of answering, a cultivator should
rise in the national council, and ask, for the exportation
of corn, an absurd premium which
would instantly enhance its price 25 <i>per cent.</i>?—But
the game of imports and exports to which
this last observation alludes, requires to be treated
in a separate article which it is not yet time to enter
upon; all we have now to do is to think on the
means of giving a free circulation to the revenue of
all <i>Europe</i>, supposed to be increased in the proportion
of 20 to 22, on account of the same increase
necessary in <i>England</i> to pay three millions interest,
without any one being the poorer for it. I
shall say nothing of the facility of paper-currency,
when the inutility of a national robbery shall be
once generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>Nineteenthly and lastly, If we are frightened
by the necessity of a balance in money,
every where more considerable, in order to
circulate every where, a revenue increased from
20 to 22, to face the indispensable rise in the
prices of <i>England</i>, who trades to all parts of the
globe; (when we consider besides, that <i>France</i>
and <i>England</i> are by the same reason obliged to
add to their respective balance already so loaded,)
it appears to me, that, after a retrospective view
of what has passed, one may readily be convinced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
that whenever money becomes necessary
for circulation, wherever nothing more is required
to circulate and balance objects really existing,
and equal to each other, there are always people
enough ready to carry money thither; and that
this operation, <i>as all those that are beneficial to
society</i>, is generally effected when it is neither
counteracted nor encouraged, <i>without any one
perceiving it</i>.—Nevertheless it must be confessed,
that the pretentions set up by <i>France</i>, in regard
to a balance, are as terrible, as formidable, as
those of <i>England</i>, due regard being paid to the
difference between the exports of both; I shall
examine these pretensions as I have done those
of <i>England</i>, and bring them besides closer to
each other, that they may be more properly
estimated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading37"><i>The pretended Balance of <span class="upright">France</span> in point of
Trade.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The Work of Mr. <i>Necker</i> on the <i>French</i>
finances, is in my judgement, for that nation,
the most precious work that this age has produced;
it is a sword hanging over the head of
whoever shall fill up that department during the
reign of the present King, and of all those of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
successors whom God shall bless with a soul like
his. That work would still be precious, though
it should serve only to expose the knavery or the
incapacity of those who pretended that <i>France</i>,
preparing for a war which required the creation of
a navy, without which she could not carry it on,
forced to have recourse to new loans proportionate
to such an undertaking, and weighed
down, as it was said, by the load of the old
taxes imposed for discharging the interest of her
former debts, was again on the eve of laying
new imposts, in spite of herself, and perhaps of
having recourse to those degrading reductions, so
lightly, yet so often practised before. The first
public operation of Mr. <i>Necker</i> (his <i>Compte rendu</i>)
inspired every one with the enthusiastic spirit of
an unbounded confidence, wherever nothing was
foreseen but the discouragement arising from discredit.
He did not create anything, it is true; but
he dispelled the clouds which had hitherto concealed
what really existed; he restored order where
confusion reigned before, and treated the mechanical
part of the finances, like a merchant
willing at all times to have it in his power to
compare his undertakings with his means, his
plans with his resources. No other step could
be taken at first. I have no kind of connexion
with Mr. <i>Necker</i>, neither direct nor indirect;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
nor am I bound to him by the ties of friendship,
interest, or gratitude; and, besides, it is
not my intention either to praise, or to censure;
yet I cannot forbear to observe, that Mr.
<i>Necker</i>, entirely circumscribed by the circumstances
of the time, charged with the triple load of
clearing up what was passed, supplying present
wants, and guarding against future events, could
only loosely survey, regret, and prepare, what a
situation so critical did not permit him to undertake.
His being displaced, left him no other
advantage than that of informing the public
of what he intended to do; and the manner in
which the nation has received the work wherein he
recorded his projects, is at the same time a tribute
of the national esteem for the man who planned
them, and a pledge of the national gratitude,
even for any one of his successors, who should
confine himself to carry them into execution.</p>

<p>Whatever I have hitherto said, whatever may
drop from my pen in the sequel, in contradiction
to some of Mr. <i>Necker</i>’s opinions, was
written long before the publication of his work,
and in no degree detracts from the solidity of his
views. What he devised was perhaps the best
that could possibly be imagined in the actual
state of things, and according to the received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
system:—But is that system the best?—I subscribe
to his principle concerning the precautions to be
taken, and the slowness of the march necessary
even through all the paths that may lead to <i>the
best</i>; but that best, what is it? <i>France</i> cannot
boast of having found it—read the work of Mr.
<i>Necker</i>; <i>England</i> cannot boast of having found
it—read the debates of both Houses of Parliament:—And
do I dare to offer my thoughts!—Yes:—two
children, it is said, found what it was
necessary to find, in order to the discovery of immense
bodies of light, at a distance where nothing
was suspected but the limits of creation.—Were
my thoughts only plausible, they ought to be
thoroughly investigated; they concern the State,
they concern mankind at large:—if they prove
just, to say that they are impracticable on account
of the shackles with which our forefathers
have loaded us, is to say nothing but with regard
to the fleeting moment in which I speak, <i>already
so far off from us</i>; but to feel then that we should
not add new shackles to those we endure already,
would be a great point gained; to scrutinise
afterwards the ancient opinions, without exception;
to analyse the principles on which
pretended impossibilities are founded; to expect
nothing from seduction or from authority;
to desire nothing but from general conviction;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
to spare no pains to make the people
sensible of, and familiar with the truths that
might be discovered, would perhaps be a second
step towards that very mark to which we should
probably direct our course, were it not for the
pretended impossibility, the mere supposition of
which casts a ridicule upon the very thought of
looking up to it.</p>

<p>It is upon this plan, and under this point of
view, that I purpose to examine the supposed
balance of <i>France</i>, in regard to trade:—and I
begin by asking, whether there exists a nation in
<i>Europe</i>, which, upon perusing what Mr. <i>Necker</i>
says to the present purpose, and the use made
almost generally in <i>England</i> of the work of Sir
<i>Charles Whitworth</i>, much more explicit with
regard to the balance of <i>Great Britain</i>, would
hesitate an instant to break off all commercial
connexions with <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>, if only one
half should prove real in the prejudices of the
two nations, on the object, which at present
seems to determine all the others?</p>

<p>I would, in the next place, propose, for examination,
whether those two nations are not indebted
to these prejudices, for the greatest part
of their mistakes, and of the obstacles which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
have found, which they still find, and which they
will ever find, in the measures that other nations
think themselves obliged to adopt, in order to
guard against the effects of those prejudices, till
their fallacy is universally acknowledged, as
well as their insufficiency to produce their boasted
effect, <i>even in favour of those who would obstinately
refuse to give them up</i>.</p>

<p>Every year, say the prejudices of both nations,
more than seven millions sterling are required for
their two <i>terrible</i> balances;—but not above six
millions are brought over from <i>America</i>:—if
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i> be allowed to come in for
one sixth (indeed it would be but just), the other
parts of <i>Europe</i> must settle it amongst themselves
to find the two millions sterling, which without
that assessment would be deficient in the balances
necessary to <i>France</i> and <i>England</i>.—Whence does
<i>Europe</i> take those two millions? Whence have
they been taken hitherto? I know not: but it is
a stubborn fact: you may consult the work of
Mr. <i>Necker</i> for the balance of <i>France</i>, and for
that of <i>England</i> the statements of Sir <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>; the former amounts annually to
70 millions of <i>livres</i>, about 3 millions sterling;
and the latter to 83,678,818<i>l.</i> in the space
of 20 years, from 1754 to 1773; it is, one year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
with another, more than 4,180,000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.
But above all, let it not escape your observation,
what is said in <i>France</i>, that the decline of
that Empire will begin, when this balance of 70
millions of <i>livres</i> shall begin to decline, and that
it is the opinion in <i>England</i>, that, were the <i>favourable
balance</i> to be below 2 or 3 millions
sterling, a national bankruptcy must indispensably
follow. What is most <i>miraculous</i> (and indeed
consolatory for those who are obliged to think
of their elevation, before they dream of a bankruptcy,
or even of their decline) is, that whilst
<i>France</i> and <i>England</i> have received annually, the
one 4, the other 3 millions sterling, that is to
say, one sixth more than <i>America</i> has to share
amongst all the <i>European</i> nations, the other
countries in <i>Europe</i> have nevertheless increased
their mass of money, by all that was necessary to
keep up their luxury, and the circulation of a
revenue which has almost doubled in the course
of a century. These are prodigies which will
cease to be so, even if we admit the facts on
which they are founded, if we take the trouble
of adding thereto a few other facts rather less
questionable; and if it be acknowledged at last,
that there are yet others, concerning which the
most expert calculator cannot flatter himself that
he shall even come near the truth, and which give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
to those who will be at the trouble of reflecting,
all the latitude they may want, to conclude that
the two supposed balances are as inadmissible when
subjected to the discussion of reason alone, as they
are afterwards demonstrated to be false, by facts
which cannot be controverted.</p>

<p>The quantity of money required for circulation,
depends neither on the speculations of a
Minister of finances, nor on the blind cupidity
of trade, which, luckily, is always counteracted
by the clear-sighted cupidity of every
trader: it depends on the quantity of articles to
be circulated, on their price, and on the method
adopted for circulation:—it is evident that less
cash is required in <i>England</i> than in <i>France</i> to circulate
the same mass of revenue, trade, and
transactions of all kinds; the reasons are obvious:
but the sum wanted for the circulation
being once found, every addition thereto is soon,
notwithstanding all ministerial machinations,
transferred to some hundred leagues distance, if
that surplus should be wanted there: now, when
this necessary sum for circulation is once ascertained,
we shall see how useless it is to despoil,
how absurd it is to suppose that they do despoil
the rest of <i>Europe</i> of her money, in order to keep
up that circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>What is the real amount of the cash circulating
in <i>England</i>? Some say 25, others 30 millions
sterling. It is probable that 25 millions are
sufficient, with the help of credit and paper-currency,
even in the supposition that <i>France</i>
should stand in want of 2 <i>milliards</i> of <i>livres</i> in
hard cash to give circulation to a revenue, double
to that of <i>England</i>, because there is in <i>France</i> no
paper-money, and much less credit than would
be obtained, were it not, <i>too often yet</i>, so easy to
avoid, by another kind of credit, the payment
of the most lawful debts: but we must argue
from an incontrovertible fact, and assent, in their
fullest scope, to the consequences that may be
deduced therefrom. The following is the fact:</p>

<p>Of all the coin circulating in <i>England</i>, 18
months ago there was only a sixth, and there
is now much less than a sixth part, in pieces
struck before the present reign. Now, in
1780, it appears that the money coined at the
Mint, in the present reign, amounted only to
30,457,805<i>l.</i></p>

<p>It is impossible to suppose, that in the space of
18 years there should have been carried out of
the kingdom, either to <i>Ireland</i>, or in support of
the smuggling trade, or for other purposes, less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
than the amount of the coin struck since that
period. Let us add to the 30 millions coined
from the beginning of this reign down to the year
1780, the 5 millions for the sixth part in old
specie remaining of the former reigns (that sixth
supposed, rather than acknowledged, to be actually
in circulation), the total will be 35 millions;
to which must be added, the value
of silver plate, toys, &amp;c. Admit, that all
these articles together, circulation and silver
wrought, amount to 50 millions sterling;—to
those who may think that the sum of 15 millions,
at which I rate the wrought silver of all kinds,
is too trifling, I would recommend to observe,
first, that these 15 millions constitute nearly the
tenth part of the general revenue, both of the
land and industry; secondly, that the third part
of that revenue belongs to the peasants and mechanics,
who have no such costly furniture; and
thirdly, that as to the rest of the nation, if there
exist a man who possesses the equivalent of one
half of his revenue in plate, there are scores who
are not possessed of so much as one tenth part.—Shall
it be insisted upon, however, that, by adding
the amount of plate and the mass in circulation
to that which <i>must</i> correspond with the
demands that may be made upon the Bank, the
whole amounts to 60 millions sterling?—Be it so;—but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
<i>England</i> was certainly in possession of 20 millions
at least, in cash and wrought silver, before
the time at which Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i> began
his Statements; for there existed then much
less credit, and no paper to answer the purposes
of cash:—forty millions, then, constitute the
whole of what <i>England</i> chose (I call it strictly a
choice) to reserve, out of so many millions imported
from <i>America</i>, which really went through
her hands, in the space of 90 years.—I am
fully persuaded that I could meet with some
thousands of persons, even in <i>England</i>, who,
from the sketch I have given, would think that I
make a present to <i>England</i> of 10 millions. It
matters not, I shall be equally generous in regard
to <i>France</i>, whose accounts I am about to
lay open; and yet I shall have gold and silver
enough left to extend my liberality all over
<i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Necker</i> has but two reasons to suppose
that there exists in the <i>French</i> circulation a sum
of 2,200,000,000 livres <i>tournois</i>. The first is
the indubitable fact, that since, and including the
general re-coining of the <i>French</i> specie in 1726
to 1783, there have been struck, in the different
mints of that kingdom, 2,500,000,000 of the
same specie (the only one that is current in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
country:) and, in the next place, the very questionable
fact, that <i>France</i> has preserved the whole,
except 3 or 400 millions <i>tournois</i>, which may
have passed into foreign hands, from the quantity
of <i>French</i> specie which must have been carried
abroad, to answer her commercial and political
purposes.</p>

<p>Say only 2000 millions of livres in the <i>French</i>
circulation, that I may not be troubled with 100
millions, which can neither weaken nor strengthen
my reasonings.</p>

<p>When that general re-coinage of the year 1726
took place in <i>France</i>, there must have existed, at
that time, 1000 millions <i>tournois</i>, to impart a
proper circulation to a revenue, which, we may
suppose, was less by one half than what it is at this
time. <i>France</i>, therefore, had occasion to increase
her specie, only by the additional thousand
of millions, of which she is now in possession,
even upon a supposition that she has now
2000 millions; and this want has been supplied
in the space of 57 years, at the rate of 18
millions only, one year with another.</p>

<p>Let it be granted, now, that the annual wants,
the personal wants of <i>France</i>, in articles of luxury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
plate, gold and silver lace, trinkets, &amp;c. amounted
to 7 millions <i>tournois</i>, upon an average, in the
course of the above 57 years.—By adding thereto
the 18 millions I have spoken of, I can find
but 25 millions overplus, one year with another,
saved by <i>France</i> upon all the treasures of <i>America</i>,
which certainly must have passed through her
hands from 1726 to 1783.</p>

<p>The reader must be sensible, that there is no
occasion to speak of the sums annually exported
to <i>India</i>, it matters not by whom; they no longer
exist for <i>Europe</i>; and I have proved nothing hitherto,
if it be still doubted that <i>Europe</i> has lost
nothing in that respect but the trifling advance
in her prices, which 100 or 150 thousand pounds
sterling, added annually to her general specie,
would have given to all the productions, both of
agriculture and industry. The return of those
150,000<i>l.</i> in <i>India</i> goods has produced yearly to
<i>Europe</i> all the labour necessary to repay them; for
it must be observed, that <i>labour pays every thing</i>,
and that nothing is paid but by <i>labour</i>. The
150,000<i>l.</i> exported to <i>India</i>, are not lost therefore,
as to their essential effect, as would be the
case of sums laid up in the coffers of a Sovereign,
who might be unacquainted, even at this day,
with what was known to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
200 years ago, that <i>the Prince’s treasures are well
placed no where, but in the hands of his subjects</i>,
that is, of <i>such</i> amongst his subjects <i>who do not
lock them up in their own chests</i>.</p>

<p>I join together the two balances of <i>France</i> and
<i>England</i>, which probably fall much below, and
which cannot be above, what I have stated them
to be; and I see that those two formidable
bugbears, after having annually devoured, according
to their own account, 7 millions sterling,
have, in the end, and very fortunately too,
only digested something less than 2 millions, viz.
the bugbear of <i>France</i>, 12 or 1300 thousand
pounds sterling; and the bugbear of <i>England</i>,
about 5, 6, or 700 thousand.</p>

<p>Thank Heaven then, there remains, after
<i>England</i> and <i>France</i> have been fully saturated,
(including the general exportation to <i>India</i>)
about 4 millions sterling, which the other States
of <i>Europe</i> have received, one year with another,
partly in plate, partly in gold and silver-lace,
partly in ingots, partly in guineas, and partly in
louis-d’ors, of which those who gave them still
think themselves in possession, and which those
who received them do not think they possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>But, it will be said, the louis d’ors, which are
spent in <i>Germany</i> during a war, revert to <i>France</i>
soon after a peace; the plenty in which they flow
back, is known to every one who has the least
concern in trade.—No doubt of it; when the
<i>German</i> circulation is overloaded, it must re-flow
where it is beneath its level: the coin carried by
the <i>French</i> into <i>Germany</i>, in the time of war, was
then indispensable there to supply the wants of
those who carried the money into that country,
and to increase the means of the ordinary circulation,
<i>an increase occasioned by a circumstance that
tertiated the price of every thing</i>. The circumstance
subsiding, every thing takes its usual
course; prices are reduced; the greatest part of
the money which had been carried there, becomes
useless on account of that reduction:—it
is sent back; and why is it taken then by <i>France</i>?
Because it is become necessary there;—for you
must observe, that the money in question was
useless in <i>France</i>, as soon as it was wanted in
<i>Germany</i>.—During the war the commerce of
<i>France</i> was at a stand; her granaries overstocked
with corn, her cellars with wine, her warehouses
with goods, waited only for peace, to set a value
on that corn, that wine, those goods, and of
course, on that idol Money, which, during the
war, could not, in regard to the <i>French</i>, be of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
value, but on the very spot where the <i>French</i> had
themselves carried it.</p>

<p>Observe, above all, that <i>England</i>, who pretends
to have the largest balance in money, is the
very nation who, with respect to the extensiveness
of her commerce and the mass of her industry,
keeps the least part of that balance at
home, and constantly preserves as little of it, as
if she had been no less convinced than I am myself,
of the futility of any other balance in bullion,
but that which is necessary for the five
articles above mentioned. What results now
from the reduction of those two frightful <i>colossi</i>
to their proper dimensions?</p>

<p>It results, First, that every system of balance,
founded on the supposition which served as a
basis to the two balances I have spoken of, is as
chimerical, as it would be pernicious to the nation
who should regulate herself by it, and to such
other nations as might be unfortunate enough to
correspond with her:</p>

<p>Secondly, That the private interest of every
merchant always militates, in this respect, against
the pernicious dreams of trade in general:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>Thirdly, That the case between nation and
nation trading together, is similar to that which
subsists between citizen and citizen; as there is
but one way for a man to prevent the last penny
of his wealth from being useful to some other
member of his community; and that way is, <i>to bury
under ground (as soon as he has received it) that
last penny, the utility of which he grudges to share
with other men</i>: in like manner, a nation can no
otherwise prevent the surplus of her money being
carried into another country when this latter
is in want of it, than <i>by burying her balance as
soon as she has received it</i>:</p>

<p>Fourthly, That the superiority of industry,
activity, and <i>capitals</i>, in a nation, gives her no
other advantage, than that of supplying those
countries with which she trades, with further
means of increasing their own industry and activity:
Now,</p>

<p>Fifthly, The more you increase industry and
activity amongst other nations, the more you
increase their want of those signs which are to
represent the products; the more you increase
their want of those signs which you long to possess
exclusively, if it were possible: Therefore,</p>

<p>Sixthly, If it be true, that money ought to be
the only aim of commerce and exportation, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
the favourite ideas on the pretended balance, being
entirely destroyed by facts, even at the time
when the world was more fully persuaded of the
truth of those ideas, and of the wisdom of the
measures which were to have perpetuated that
balance, it would be necessary henceforth to resolve
to hide money under ground, as fast as it
comes in.—Would it not be better to question
the principle itself, and seek for fresh information
on the utility as well as the object of exportation?</p>

<p>A world of unanswerable arguments start
up at once, tending to demonstrate the superiority
of civilization over the wild state of nature. Yet,
methinks, a savage may overturn them all by these
few words: <i>I know nothing of what you say, and
I am not inquisitive</i>.—I readily confess at least,
that I do not see what reply can be made to such
an answer, more than I did with regard to the
four questions put in the Upper House to the
manufacturer of whom I have spoken; yet this
manufacturer was not stronger in argument on all
that was foreign to the essential point of the four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
questions, than I might be to convince my savage
of that delight, which a man fully persuaded of
the excellence of his own conceits, and of the
happiness there is in making them known to all
the world, feels, without allay, without interruption,
in staining some reams of paper, scribbling
sometimes an hypothesis, sometimes a comedy,
a romance, a ballad, &amp;c.; for it is very
true, that the work I now lay before the public,
has, in the space of 12 or 15 years, undergone
all those metamorphoses in my hands, and that
during that time my heart rankled with the ambition
of being read in antichambers, given for
premiums in colleges, tolerated in nunneries,
mentioned in the <i>boudoirs</i> of the fair, noticed in
the memory of Ministers, revolved in the hearts
of Sovereigns, and every day sung about the streets
and in cottages, through which all princes must
sometimes pass, if they wish to discover some
decisive difference between the interesting illusions
of humanity and the deep speculations of
politics. Yet with all that stock of words, if
not of reasons, that I must have acquired beforehand,
to justify, in some measure, the extravagance
of such an ambition, I own that I should
be confounded by the answer of my savage.—But
this could not be the case, if a civilised man,
after having convinced me, that the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
of commerce between man and man, as well as
between nation and nation, consists in supplying
each other’s wants, when it is possible to effect
it by an exchange of surplusses, would next undertake
to prove to me, that the advantage of a
State, which is nothing else but a nation, an
aggregation of men, consists in keeping as much
as possible of that money which they have in too
great abundance, though the inevitable consequence
would be, that they would procure to
themselves so much less of some article in which
they might be deficient, but which it would at
the same time be very convenient to them to
possess.—It is hard that the compendium of prohibitions,
restrictions, &amp;c. so much commended,
and which have kept so many great men so long
on the watch, dwindles finally into the assertion
of the two contradictory propositions which I
have just now dated.</p>

<p>Two articles are necessary and sufficient to
man—bread and water; let not meat be called
in as a third; it is too well known, that three
fourths of <i>Europe</i> seldom eat any, and doubtless
no one will contend that three fourths of a
whole are less valuable than the fourth remaining,
in the eyes of Him who created that whole,
and who probably takes some concern in its
preservation. Exchanges of any other articles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
besides bread and water, are therefore, strictly
speaking, <i>exchanges of mere superfluities</i>. Now,
what inconvenience can there be in bartering one
superfluity against another?</p>

<p>I shall first of all, display in their full force,
the most solid reasonings that can possibly be
adduced, in order to demonstrate, that <i>the choice
and price of all superfluities must be left to the discretion
of one set of men only</i>. The chymist is
not to blame if he can extract nothing but a
fetid oil from the matter which he undertakes to
decompound.</p>

<p>That set of men, as estimable, as worthy as
any in the world, will perhaps wonder when they
see the analysis of those ideas, which, probably,
they never submitted but to a superficial examination.</p>

<h3><i>Prohibitory Laws against Exportation.</i></h3>

<p><i>Query.</i> Why do you solicit a prohibitory law
against the exporting of such an article of national
product?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> That I may get it <i>cheaper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you buy it <i>cheaper</i>, without wronging
the man who might sell it <i>dearer</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> As it is impossible to prove that such a
conduct is equitable, how will you be able to
prove it to be advantageous to the State?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is advantageous to the State, that all its
internal productions should receive at home, all
such forms and preparations as may increase their
value.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is the quantity of productions useful to
the State?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The question is almost ridiculous.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If the <i>productor</i> be discouraged by the low
price set upon his productions, and take proper
measures to produce <i>less</i>, in order to save the expence
attending a <i>greater</i> production, and in the
mean time to gain by producing <i>less</i> as much as
he could gain by producing <i>more</i>, will you not
then be guilty of having wronged the State of all
the productions which you crush in the very
bud, by the prohibition you sue for?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; Smuggling will give to the parties
injured by the prohibitory law, a fully sufficient
means of extricating themselves.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Your hopes then are, that Smuggling will
make up for the injuries you propose to do to the
<i>productors</i>; but how will you compensate to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
State for the loss it sustains by a clandestine
exportation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Our only business is to mind our own interest;
besides, the State may easily procure, by
means of a land-tax, what it may lose by the
clandestine exportation: and we are so far from
expecting that Smuggling should turn out to our
advantage, that we petition it may be made a
capital offence, and prohibited under pain of
mutilation, the galleys, or at least the entire ruin
of the smuggler.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But the law will either succeed, or fail in
its effect. If the law succeed, will you not be
the author of that diminution of the products,
which the low price you intend to set upon those
products must unavoidably occasion? And if
the law fail in its effect, do you not uselessly deprive
the State, 1st, of the produce of the smuggler’s
labour, whom you hope to see hanged, or
at best, mutilated; and, 2dly, of the produce of
that labour which would have been performed
by that army, partly composed of rogues, partly
of idle fellows, now to be set upon the watch
to detect and apprehend the smuggler, keep him
in close confinement, and lead him finally to the
<i>gallows</i>, or to the <i>galleys</i>?—Who is to pay those
rogues and idle fellows?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The State, to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the essential parts of the
State?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Industry that goes in search of money, and
Agriculture in as much as she feeds Industry <i>at
the cheapest rate</i>.</p>

<p>Agriculture, impoverished by your prohibitory
law, will then lose, not only what she
should get by being at liberty to export, but
also what she must find to assist you in procuring
her impoverishment, by paying the land-tax
necessary to pay those very rogues and idle fellows,
whose business it is to destroy her only
remaining resource against your cupidity—<span class="smcap">smuggling</span>.</p>

<h3><i>Prohibitory Laws against, or excessive Duties imposed
upon Importation.</i></h3>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why do you petition against the liberty of
importing such or such another article?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because we manufacture it, and wish to
sell it dearer to the national consumers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Of how many orders of men is the class
of national consumers composed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of two, the land proprietor, and all persons
not wholly destitute of money.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> That is to say, <i>in all cases</i>, of the whole
kingdom, against the small number of individuals
who humbly petition for the prohibition of
an article;—be it so. Have you devised any
means to increase in the consumer the ability of
purchasing, whilst you advance the price of
your goods?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not we;—on the contrary, it is our intention
to have as much as we can of his commodities
and money, for as little of our goods as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How can men of probity and knowledge
be blind to the iniquity of such a scheme?—Will
not at least its execution be somewhat impeded by
the greatest part of those who follow the same
trade?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No—that is impossible: our <i>corporations</i>
have already provided against the inconvenience
you allude to: not one of their members would
dare to sell his merchandise below the price fixed
by his <i>corporation</i>: and we have made, as it
were, the <i>impossibility</i> of any such measure,
<i>doubly</i> so, by the difficulties we have devised to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
prevent a ready admittance into our <i>corporations</i>;
all our bye-laws tend to reduce our associates
to the smallest number possible. But one single
expedient is now wanted to put the finishing
hand to that grand work; it is the absolute prohibition
of importing all those commodities
which foreign nations might offer at a cheaper
rate, than we are determined to sell them at.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> So then, if you succeed in your plan—if
by means of the solicited prohibition, the legislature
enable you to extort, with your 16 in
merchandise, the goods and money, which, in
the case of a foreign competition, you could not
have procured with less than 20, what do you intend
to do with the remaining part of what you
shall have extorted?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> We shall send it abroad.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> With what view?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of increasing the balance in money.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you hitherto acted confidently with
that idea?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> We have—and it is known to all the world
that it is the dearest idea of an <i>Englishman</i>—an
idea which the nation holds (if properly attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
to) as the only bulwark against a national bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What have you got by that idea, if it be
probable that there is not above 25 or 30 millions
in specie within the kingdom, and if it be
proved evidently that it is impossible you should
have more than 35?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The reason is, no doubt, that foreign importation
has been too freely permitted; a criminal,
a traiterous indulgence which we are incessantly
at work to remove: and it is on that account,
that besides the absolute prohibition we
now pray for in regard to such and such articles,
we also petition that the duties be laid
double and treble on all other foreign articles
which are not yet totally prohibited.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you not fear that foreigners, whose
merchandise you would cause to be prohibited,
should play the same trick with yours? Do you
not fear that those on whose goods you mean to
increase the duties, should in their turn overload
those which they will receive from you?—For this
is all the conjuration requisite to counteract and
balance the effect of those sublime regulations
which you petition for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> We shall carry on a smuggling trade in
their country, and they will pay dearer for our
goods; they cannot do without them.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> They will, no doubt, follow your example:
therefore new recruits will be wanted
for that army of rogues and idlers, designed to
lay hold of, and ruin whoever should dare to
oppose your ransoming the owners of lands, and
proprietors of some money; but be it so:—you
will besides be equally successful in obliging
the poor ransomed individuals, to pay for the additional
and necessary reinforcement of your
standing army of rogues and idlers, and for those
light troops of informers so well fitted for the
noble purpose you are carrying on;—be it so
again.—But, after all, what are you to do with
that immense balance in money?—Shall you
bury it under ground?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Aye—and with all our hearts and souls, if,
when thus buried, it could bring to us the same
benefit as when it is rendered useful to some one
else; but alas! that secret is not yet found out:
it might be possible, however, to pray for an Act
of Parliament, compelling the nation to pay the
interest of all the sums thus interred by us; and
the wisdom of such an Act would be the more
conspicuous, as it would keep within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
reach, under the very hand of the nation, all the
money she might have occasion for, whenever
she should think it expedient to declare war against
<i>France, our natural enemy</i>. Till such an Act is
framed, we shall follow the example of <i>Holland</i>;
we shall keep on the carrying trade, by which
the <i>Dutch</i> have gained so much money notwithstanding
our Navigation Act, which we fondly
hoped was calculated to effect their ruin: we
shall carry from <i>Russia</i> to <i>Sicily</i>, from <i>Constantinople</i>
to <i>Poland</i>, from <i>Stockholm</i> to <i>Cadiz</i>,
from <i>Lisbon</i> to <i>Venice</i>, whatever may be carried
from one place to the other, and this we shall do
at the lowest prices, in order to get the preference
of the <i>Dutch</i>. It is a great pity that this
cannot be effected without benefiting the land-owners,
and the proprietors of some money, in
all the countries where we may stand in competition
for that carrying trade, not only with the
<i>Dutch</i>, but with all the national monopolists who
shall not have as yet been dexterous enough to
force from their legislature, laws as <i>favourable to
commerce</i> as those we have obtained; but in fact,
what matters it to us whom we serve, provided
we get a good profit from the service?</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Will you add further: <i>And provided also that
the service done, falls not on the land-owner, or on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
the proprietor of some money within your nation</i>?—Yet
thus far would you finally be led by that
system of prohibitions and restrictions, almost
equally extravagant, to which you are so devoutly
attached.—But such a plan can succeed
only to a certain degree: be pleased to observe,
that hitherto you can boast of no other advantage
but that of the first attack.—Sole and absolute arbiters
as you are of your own prices by the monopoly
you have obtained, if agriculture had not advanced
those of her products in the same proportion,
would not your land-owners be compelled to
seek abroad for a country where monopoly should
not be so obligingly countenanced? For you do
not, I presume, flatter yourselves that you shall be
able to induce your Parliament, in the age we live
in, doubly to tax the property of those who might
look abroad for a remedy against your extortions:—the
many laws of that kind consigned to your
annals, (and which you would not fail to quote
as a precedent,) must seek in the ignorance and
barbarity of the age that gave them birth, an
apology for their establishment; but at this present
time!—Such shades in the picture of the Land
of Liberty, instead of setting off the beauties of
its other parts, would annihilate the very idea of
that liberty. <i>It is by justice and freedom that we
are attracted and retained; it is by injustice and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
restraint that we are expelled, and kept at a distance.</i>
Be pleased then, in fine, to observe that nothing
can result from those plans, the iniquity of which
you have no more searched into than you have
thoroughly examined their consequences,—from
those prohibitions and restrictions, the effects of
which must be counterbalanced by contradictory
regulations,—except the pitiful advantage of
having perverted the nature of the prices on every
article. <i>What is necessary to counteract the effect of
an injury done to the generality, will always mechanically
be brought about by that very generality.</i>
Would it not be more advantageous for men, to
agree amongst themselves, like intelligent beings,
on some plans accounted equitable by all,—on
plans the analysis of which the projector
might bear without a blush?—Were a few points
agreed upon, it would not perhaps be difficult to
settle all the others.</p>

<p>Let the dead bodies be wrapped up in
woollen instead of linen cloth; linen coming
from abroad, wool being a staple commodity, and
the dead caring little whether their winding-sheet
be made of woollen or linen: it is a point of
economy which it would be rather too severe to
condemn, although it is probable enough that
in the North they would exchange with pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
for your <i>buried woollen</i>, linen cloth in sufficient
quantity to wrap up your dead; a circumstance
which might prove very beneficial to some of
the living, both in <i>England</i> and <i>Silesia</i>. But
will you attempt to persuade, that it is advantageous
to the State, under any aspect, to compel
a man who calls himself free, to wear manufactured
buttons, when his inclination would lead
him to have them made of remnants of stuff?
Will you attempt to persuade, that it is advantageous
to the State, to make him pay a penalty of
3 or 4 pounds, besides cost, if he is surprised
<i>flagrante delicto</i>? Will you attempt to persuade,
that it is advantageous to the State, to encourage
the infamous trade of informing, by a reward in
favour of an informer, against a man guilty of
<i>such a crime</i>? Will you attempt to persuade, that
it is advantageous to the State, to withdraw from
their useful occupations a swarm of fellows, <i>become
capable of any dirty work</i>, by having turned
informers on account of the stipulated recompense,
and who, waiting for an opportunity of
doing worse, leave their work-shops as soon as
such a law is passed, in search of a prey the seisure
of which will enable them to live in riot and intoxication
for a whole week together, without
being obliged to return to their work? This is
not all; for, in fine, if all the branches of industry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
have the same right to the protection of
Government, does not a law, the immediate
effect of which is to enhance the price of buttons
by occasioning a greater demand for that article,
destroy all idea of that protection equally due to
the other branches of industry, by infallibly depriving
some of them, both of the amount of the
cash they might have received from those who
will now be forced, against their inclination, to
purchase manufactured buttons, and of the
amount of cash which the advanced price of manufactured
buttons, will unjustly wrest from
those who, by the effect of the law, are obliged
to pay dearer for what they might have procured
at a cheaper rate? Would not the least facility
granted for the importation of some foreign merchandise,
have occasioned abroad a greater consumption,
either of buttons, or of some other
<i>English</i> goods, than such a law can procure at
home in the manufactory unjustly favoured?
But, above all, will you attempt to persuade,
that it is advantageous for the State, to acquire a
thousand more button-makers, when that acquisition
is obtained by the loss of a thousand
artificers employed in manufacturing some other
articles, the consumption of which would have
been <i>free</i>, that is, analogous to the situation of
those who boast of their being so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>Let us seek for such points, as it may be
possible to agree upon.</p>

<p>The State is composed of three orders of men,
all equally precious, and whose rights are equally
sacred; <i>viz.</i> the landed <i>capitalist</i>, the <i>capitalist</i>
of industry, and the proprietor of money, whether
he be considered as a <i>capitalist</i> in this last
respect, or only as a dependent on either of the
two former <i>capitalists</i>. Each of these three orders
has its interest.</p>

<p>First, It is the highest interest of the landed <i>capitalist</i>,
that there be the greatest plenty and variety
of the best products of industry, and the
greatest consumption of the productions of the
earth.</p>

<p>Secondly, It is the highest interest of the <i>capitalist</i>
of industry, that there be the greatest plenty
and variety of the best productions of the earth,
and the greatest consumption of the products of
industry.</p>

<p>Thirdly, It is the highest interest of the money
proprietor, that there be the largest quantity
and variety of the best products both of industry
and agriculture, in order that he may be able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
to support the value of his capital by the quantity
of objects on which he will have it in his
power to lay it out, and the value of his interest
by the greatest possible consumption, not at the
lowest price, which, supposed lasting, is as chimerical
as the pretended balance, <i>constantly favourable</i>,
but at the most equitable rate, that is
to say, the highest the seller can hope for, and
the lowest to which the purchaser can pretend.</p>

<p>But if it be true, that the combined interest of
the three orders be centered within the three
points I have stated, namely, the greatest possible
quantity and variety of the best productions
of the earth, the greatest quantity and variety
of the best products of industry, and the greatest
as well as most unconfined consumption of both
at an equitable price; it is equally true, that it
must be a matter of perfect indifference to agriculture,
in what part of the world, and by whom
her productions are consumed, provided they
be paid to her in any products whatever, at
her option equivalent to those she has parted
with. It is no less true, that it is a matter
of perfect indifference to industry, in what
part of the world, and by whom, her products
are consumed, provided she be paid for them in
any products whatever, at her option, equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
to those she gives. It is equally true, that the
money-proprietor must view, with the same indifference,
his property giving life to this or that
branch of industry or agriculture, provided, that
in the hour of need or fancy, he finds at hand,
on the most equitable terms, the greatest quantity
and variety of the best products of agriculture
and industry, which the interest of his money, or
the amount of the salaries he enjoys, gives him <span class="smcap">a
right</span> to expect.</p>

<p>There remains, it is true, a fourth interest,
that of the <i>Fisc</i>, or public revenue; but if this
revenue be nothing more than the produce of
the taxes, this fourth interest consists of course,
as the three former, in the largest quantity of
products, and the greatest consumption. Now
are there any other means to obtain those two
objects, besides the freest and most extensive exchange,
not of goods for money, but of goods for
goods? Is it not perceivable, that all the four
interests united, as well as each of them separately,
require that no more be imported in bullion
or money than the quantity necessary to
facilitate those exchanges? Is not a surplus of
money not only useless, but even detrimental, in
diminishing our enjoyments, our possible profits,
and <i>that consumption which produces the public
revenue</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>The Navigation Act was, if you will have it
so, the last effort of the human mind, at a time
when every notion relative to commerce, was
nearly confined to <i>England</i> alone; but I question
much whether the <i>Opposition</i> the most warm in
invoking that tutelary God, against the Minister
who dares to offer the least encroachment upon
its worship, would not be very much pleased to
see it destroyed before they themselves should
come into office: it is an old idol, to which
incense is offered through mere policy, and for
which a veneration is kept up in the minds of the
people, for the sole purpose of making it subservient
to the downfall of the man who might be
courageous enough to attempt its destruction.
I shall pass over in silence the obstacles which
that famous Act daily opposes to regulations as
well adapted to the present state of things, as
those it contains were to the circumstances that
gave it birth; but, to the intoxication produced
by its success, I shall be bold enough to impute
one of the most mistaken notions on the true
aim of national commerce: it is a very fatal
error, to imagine that money ought to be the
<i>object</i> of those operations of which it is only the
<i>means</i>. This chimera, it is true, has never been
realised; the wisdom of private cupidities has
always triumphed over the folly of general cupidity:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
nothing more clear than the exactness with
which the treasures of <i>America</i> have been shared
amongst all the nations of <i>Europe</i>, each in proportion
to her agriculture and her industry, that
is, according to her wants: at least it appears to
me, that the two balances of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>,
which I have produced, are incontrovertible
proofs of what I here advance, though they have
been imagined and received as proofs of the very
contrary; nevertheless, the prejudice concerning
these two <i>formidable balances</i> still subsists, and it is
this prejudice which daily gives life to new prohibitions,
and new restrictions: there is not perhaps
in all <i>Europe</i>, a single modern regulation of that
kind which does not owe its establishment to this
prejudice, and to the power it derives from the
veneration paid to it in the place where it was
first conceived. The nation who takes the lead
in point of commercial knowledge, is every
where carefully watched. On the least of her
operations, other nations make use of the light
she has held forth; her principles are studied, her
maxims adopted, her examples followed; every
where they are on their guard against her pretensions,
pretensions openly avowed, prosecuted
without mystery, and crowned, as it is supposed,
with success; and when they see, that within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
course of a twelvemonth, she has really received
more gold and silver than she was wont to receive
in three years; when they see the intoxication
of her inhabitants on the arrival of those
treasures which obey her call from all parts of
<i>Europe</i>; when they hear the complaints of her
news-paper writers against the untractableness of
the <i>Americans</i>, in not suffering themselves to be
entirely stripped of their specie; when they attend
to her invectives on the combinations of the
<i>American</i> merchants to prevent those of <i>England</i>
from taking away that trifling sum in specie
which the <i>United States</i> want, to give more consistency
to their paper-money;—<i>then</i>, indeed,
<i>then</i> it is possible to forget every thing else; it is
possible not to remark, that, with the same excess
of avowed cupidity, <i>England</i>, nevertheless,
has not received, in the course of a whole century,
(<i>a period sufficient to determine an experiment</i>)
<i>England</i>, I say, during a whole century,
has disdained to receive her dividend of the treasures
imported into <i>Europe</i>; the paper-money
circulating in <i>England</i> stands evidently in lieu of
a great part of the sum it represents, <i>and which
it was at her own option to procure</i>. It is also
very pardonable not to reflect <i>then</i>, that it is
impossible for <i>England</i> to keep long in her hands
without hurting herself, more than any other nation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
any money above what is necessary for her.
No one takes the trouble of arguing long on
causes, when the effect is instantaneously and
powerfully felt: <i>Not <span class="upright">Europe</span> alone, but the <span class="upright">United
States</span> of <span class="upright">America</span>, are stript of their money by <span class="upright">England</span>;
<span class="upright">England</span> therefore wants not any longer to
import foreign goods, or when she advances the price
of her own merchandise, she refuses paying dearer for
that of other nations.</i> The other nations do not
hesitate—<i>English</i> goods are instantly prohibited.</p>

<p>The following principles are such as, I think,
can never mislead.</p>

<p>There is not a single nation that cannot boast
some palpable advantage over another; nay, there
is not a nation, a single province, that has not
received some peculiar favour from nature, which
the same soil to all appearance, the same temperature,
the same exposure, refuse to yield
any where else but <i>with double the labour, and
double the expence</i>, and which, even with such
additional aids, they yield at last only in a state
of degradation. Now, that portion of such peculiar
favours, which the proprietor of the land
does not chuse to consume, belongs only to the
greatest quantity of other favours that it is possible
to procure in exchange. The more the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
proprietor procures of such other favours in
exchange, the more is he encouraged to increase
the quantity of articles which have enabled
him to procure those favours; on the
contrary, the more he is restrained with regard
to those exchanges which he might procure,
the more he is circumscribed, even in his
means of production. Every restriction therefore
tending to diminish either the production
or the price of any article whatever, is a theft
committed upon the proprietor of the land,
upon the province blessed with that favour which
is peculiar to it, upon the nation whose general
revenue is decreased by the whole amount of the
productions stifled in the very bud, upon the
exchequer of that nation which would receive a
duty on those productions; and finally upon every
one capable of presenting the nation with another
exchangeable commodity, or waiting only to
see those productions, in order to create an equivalent
to pay for them.—Does it signify in what
part of the world? Must it not, at last, reach
the original proprietor, if he be not paid?</p>

<p>What is said of the productions of agriculture,
may be applied to those of industry. It is a
gross mistake to imagine, that all things can be
equally well manufactured every where: how
many fabrics, the perfection of which depends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
on the quality of the water, and other local causes
for which it is impossible to account! How
many more derive their perfection from the bent
of national genius, from the general dispositions,
the natural qualities of the inhabitants! Can
we expect from the vivacity of the <i>Frenchman</i>,
who desires only to consume, what we may expect
from the patience of the <i>Englishman</i>, who
labours only to enjoy? This latter will always,
and in spite of himself, give to his work a solidity
which will increase its price as well as its value;
the other, in spite of himself, will be busy
about the forms best calculated to procure a
quick sale: objects of real comfort will always
belong to the former, the latter will ever lead the
fashions. To hope that the one will produce,
without difficulty, what costs little or nothing to
the other, would be attempting to give to the
wines of hot countries the pleasing acidity proper
to the wines of <i>Germany</i>; to these, the restorative
and balsamic qualities of the <i>Spanish</i> and
<i>Italian</i> wines in the places where they understand
how to make them; to the wines of <i>Italy</i> and
<i>Germany</i>, that native generosity proper to the
wine of <i>Bordeaux</i>; to all of them, the flavour of
<i>Burgundy</i> and the sprightliness of <i>Champaign</i>. It
is possible, say they, to imitate every thing;—say
rather, to adulterate, to corrupt, nay even to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
poison every thing, if Art can find no other way
to counterfeit Nature: <i>and these are the blessed
effects of restrictions and prohibitions</i>. It is a
strange idea, to think of doing without others; as
if that did not lead them to think of doing without
us; as if the savage, of whom I have spoken, had
not the same reason to prefer his state to that of
civilisation.</p>

<p>Nor would it be less strange to persist in setting
the interest of the people in opposition to that
of the Exchequer, if it were possible to reconcile
them together, <i>instead of rendering, almost on
every object at present, the infamous trade of informers
more lucrative than labour</i>.</p>

<p>Smuggling is hurtful to the State; it deprives
government of the duties on the articles smuggled
into or out of the kingdom; but is it so very
advantageous to succeed in the measures adopted
to prevent it, if by bartering a great number of
honest smugglers against a great number of informers
and a great number of custom-house
imps, you make so many thieves of the first, so
many much more contemptible wretches of the
second, a rabble almost equally vile as the third;
and succeed, at the same time, in debasing in
the hands of several manufacturers and landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
proprietors, the value of all those articles, which
were before taken from them by the smugglers
to their mutual benefit?</p>

<p><i>England</i>, it is true, suffered no damage, when
a prodigious quantity of <i>English</i> goods, which
are not comprehended in the <i>modest</i> balance with
<i>France</i>, as stated by Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>, because
they were introduced into <i>France</i> by smugglers,
were sold nevertheless, without much ado, all over
that kingdom, and particularly in <i>Paris</i>, publicly
advertised on the shop-boards, in large gold letters;—but
had not <i>France</i> some reason to think
herself ill used, when an equal quantity of <i>French</i>
goods, introduced also by smugglers into <i>England</i>,
without any information given to Sir <i>Charles</i>,
ceased to pay the value of the goods smuggled
from <i>England</i>, and sold publicly all over <i>France</i>,
and when, instead of a small balance, sometimes
given, sometimes received, <i>France</i> found herself
obliged to remit to <i>London</i> an enormous sum in
hard cash, for payments which she had hitherto
discharged in merchandise?</p>

<p>It is a pitiful policy on the part of <i>France</i>,
(as remarked very justly in all the <i>English</i> papers
after the first of <i>August</i>, 1785) to deprive herself
of a thousand <i>English</i> luxuries which she is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
fond of, and which she is so able to procure;—but
is <i>English</i> policy much better, in rejecting
thousands of <i>French</i> luxuries, which she
finds so pleasing, and which she is so able to
pay for?</p>

<p>Smuggling is but a very poor corrective, a
partial corrective, of the iniquity ever attendant
on Monopoly;—a feeble compensation for the
restrictions and prohibitions obtained in its
favour: Smuggling, duly considered in this
light, is but too just; and it is shocking to be
obliged to punish so barbarously the unhappy
men who gain a living by it. But will not this
necessity be removed, together with smuggling
itself, at the very moment that to those absurd
regulations which encourage that practice,
shall be substituted a system of bartering,
equally advantageous to the nations which now
find a benefit in smuggling?—a system, which
would mutually furnish to all parties interested,
all the means of introducing and procuring, in
the best condition, at the cheapest rate, with the
least risk, and with the greatest advantage to
the Treasury, every article which before was
introduced and procured at a greater risk,
almost always dearer, of the worst quality, and
to the detriment of the public revenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>Let me ask whether that mass of prohibitions
and restrictions, which <i>legally</i> establishes
monopoly in <i>England</i>, be any thing more than
a mass of privileges granted to a chosen few,
to the prejudice of the whole community? Were
we to look at every particular regulation, and
consider it distinctly, is there one which would
not find the whole nation against it, <i>except the
humble Petitioners who share in the benefit</i>?
And must it not be very strange to imagine,
very absurd to say, and above human power to
effect, that a system of regulations, not one
of which favours above one man against thousands,
should, upon the whole, be serviceable to
the State?</p>

<p>Independent of the advantages which would
arise from a truly free and judicious system of
commerce, viz. 1st, That of procuring what
we have not, by means of some article which
we have in abundance, and which our neighbours
want;—2dly, The bartering of the superfluity
of our best articles in one kind, for
the superfluity of what is best in a different
kind;—3dly, Not to barter what we can make
cheaper than others, except for goods which
would cost us more were we to manufacture
them;—independent, I say, of these three,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
advantages, where would be the inconvenience,
though our bartering should be confined merely
to the innocent folly of exchanging one toy for
another, or one rag for another? The great,
the true, the only advantage, of an exchange of
property, would not even in this case be lost to
mankind; the man who is employed only in
marking the game, while two persons are amusing
themselves, whole days, in tossing a ball from
one to the other in a tennis-court, is nevertheless
supported at the expence of the players. And
are not the owner of the court, his wife and
children, maintained likewise at their cost? If,
having considered the Exchequer metaphorically,
under the type of the Keeper of the
Tennis Court, we afterwards, without a metaphor,
consider this Keeper as a poor man
who chooses this way of subsistence, do not the
players pay this tax (which they impose on themselves)
in favour of the poor, with more pleasure,
though the tax may be greater, than a certain
other tax, which perhaps becomes necessary, only
from the difficulties with which we embarrass
both the game of passing from one parish to another,
and the game of imports and exports,
which is as innocent, and more lucrative than
that of tennis?</p>

<p>When a manufacturer is compelled, by the
general augmentation of prices, arising from
taxation, to pay his workmen and materials ten
<i>per cent.</i> I suppose, dearer than usual, and he
exports 1000 hats, <i>upon each of which</i> a draw-back
of 6 shillings, I will suppose, is allowed
him on exportation, he does not reflect on the
difference of 10 <i>per cent.</i> diffused through the
general run of prices, by the mechanical reaction
of the total of the taxes on all that is not
taxed; he remembers well the effect of this reaction
in the account which he makes out for
himself, to know at what rate he must in future
sell his hats in foreign markets; he only considers
the draw-back, the remittance of the 6 shillings
duty, and concludes that it puts him in a
situation to deal with foreigners on the same
terms as he did previous to the taxes, which
have increased every thing to the amount of 10
<i>per cent</i>. Nevertheless, the thousand hats, with
which, previous to the taxes, he furnished his
foreign friends for 1000<i>l.</i> I will suppose, are now
raised to 1200<i>l.</i>—Point out this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
to him, he will tell you he cannot sell his hats
cheaper, and that foreigners must pay 1200<i>l.</i> instead
of 1000<i>l.</i> since the foreigner wants them.
“Besides, (says he) what is the sum of two hundred
pounds more, divided among a thousand
persons, who will purchase the hats from the
merchant abroad, to whom he sells them?”
The manufacturer does not want to look further;
and the writer who from the nature of
his subject, or his manner of considering it, wants
only to reflect a little more, will only add, <i>Thus
it is that foreigners pay our taxes, and never suspect
that they do so</i>. This is the truth, but not
the whole truth. I shall endeavour to find it out.</p>

<p>The general trade of <i>England</i> with the rest of
<i>Europe</i> is not confined to some thousands of
pounds sterling, to be settled once for all; it is
an immense sum, <i>which must</i> be renewed every
year. Let us begin by being thoroughly convinced
of this necessity, in order to submit to its
consequences: we shall find moreover that these
consequences are not destructive.</p>

<p>The annual exports of <i>England</i> amount to
about a fifth of the products of her industry, and
consequently represent about a fifth of the labour
of her artificers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>If the taxes, after the war of 1755, had raised
the price of every thing at the rate of 10 <i>per cent.</i>
(I can err but by a little more or less) the total
of her exports, which, before that war, amounted,
on a medium of ten years, (see Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>)
only to a sum of 12,776,614 pounds
sterling, let us say 13 millions, amounted, after
the peace, to 14 millions 300 thousand.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose the trade of <i>England</i> exhibiting
to its foreign correspondents, in the year
1762, this total in exports of 13 millions (at the
old prices) under the name of 14 millions 300
thousand pounds, (a price rendered unavoidable
by the advance in the prices of all commodities,
on account of the taxes); and let us suppose these
correspondents to have, really and annually, no
more to pay them than 13 millions of their own
manufactures, indicated by this modest number,
because they had not the honour to support,
during seven years, a war the most brilliant and
successful in the memory of man, in <i>Germany</i>,
<i>America</i>, and <i>India</i>. I think one of the three
following consequences must be the result:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Either</i></p>

<p>That the total of <i>English</i> exports must have
been reduced from 14 millions 300 thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
pounds to 13 millions, for want of means in our
foreign buyers to pay the whole amount of <i>English</i>
exports at their advanced price:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>That <i>England</i> must have been complaisant
enough to call 13 millions, in a foreign market,
the amount of her exports, which the effects of
her new taxes obliged her to call 14 millions 300
thousand pounds at home:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Or</i>,</p>

<p>That <i>England</i> must have allowed her foreign
connexions to call 14 millions 300 thousand
pounds the same quantity and quality of their
manufactures, which, before the effect of <i>English</i>
taxation, they called only 13 millions, and
which, <i>till then</i>, had made the balance of what
they imported from <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>In the first case, the <i>English</i> manufactories,
which furnish the exports, would have been necessarily
reduced one tenth; upon which it is
necessary to observe, that the tenth of the <i>English</i>
exportation makes a fiftieth of the total value of
the product of her industry, and that the inutility
of the fiftieth of those products, occasioned by
the impossibility of their being purchased by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
foreigners at the price occasioned by the <i>English</i>
new taxes, must have deprived of subsistence, as
well as of employment, a fiftieth of the <i>English</i>
artisans, and rendered useless a fiftieth of the capitals
appropriated to exportation.</p>

<p>In the second case, the prices of commodities
would not be perceptibly increased any where
else but in <i>England</i>; the prices of her correspondents
would have been, ten years after the peace,
almost as they were in 1754.</p>

<p>In the third case, the prices would have increased,
among the foreign correspondents of the
<i>English</i>, nearly in the same proportion as in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>The first case is evidently false, since Sir <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>’s <i>Statements</i> prove that the exports
of <i>England</i>, which amounted, as we have before
observed, upon a medium of 10 years before the
war, only to 12 millions 776,614 pounds sterling,
amounted, upon a medium of 10 years
after the peace, to 14 millions 921,067 pounds
sterling, and even to 15 millions 11,211 pounds
sterling, if we take a medium of 12 years from
the peace to 1773, at which period Sir <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>’s <i>Statements</i> conclude; (which exhibits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
<i>independently of the nominal augmentation supposed
to have been occasioned by the taxes</i>, a <i>real</i>
augmentation of about a 17th, notwithstanding
<i>the real vacuum owing to the loss of those men who
would have increased this exportation, if they had
not perished in <span class="upright">Germany</span>,
<span class="upright">India</span>, <span class="upright">America</span>, and
at sea</i>.)</p>

<p>The second case is more universally acknowledged
to be false, since there is not a single
country in <i>Europe</i> where the price of every thing
has not, upon a medium, increased at least 10
<i>per cent.</i> from 1754 to 1770;—which proves the
truth of the third case:—thus it happens that foreigners
have paid the old taxes of <i>England</i>, without
suspecting it; as <i>England</i> does not, in the least,
suspect that those taxes are no longer paid either
in <i>England</i> or elsewhere, although their produce
returns nevertheless to the public creditor.</p>

<p>Let us consider, however, whether this general
increase of prices could finally prove prejudicial
to <i>England</i>, or to her connexions abroad.</p>

<p>It could not prove so to <i>England</i>, because she
was obliged to submit to this increase, or else to give
up the manufacturing of a tenth of the commodities
she exported to foreign countries (<i>where she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
exports nothing of what she can sell at home</i>), and
because a deficiency of a 10th of her exports
would have inevitably deprived a 50th of her
artisans of sustenance, and rendered useless a 50th
of the capitals devoted to exportation. Besides,
considering this object in another light, what loss
would <i>England</i> sustain by receiving, under the
denomination of 14, I suppose, the same commodities
which before were furnished for 13,
while she gave for the purchase, only 13 (old
prices) which the effect of taxation made her
call 14?</p>

<p>It could not prejudice her foreign connexions,
because this increase of prices, which <i>abroad was
not owing to taxation</i>, was only an encouragement
to labour, which must in general have increased
its products, always entitled to a profit
over and above the price paid for that labour.</p>

<p>A circumstance which was necessary for <i>England</i>,
without doing her the least harm, has,
then, proved useful to the rest of <i>Europe</i>.⸺</p>

<p>But let up remark two very essential points:</p>

<p>The first is, that it is impossible in the nature
of things, to keep up foreign consumption, <i>upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
which depends the continuation of our exports</i>,
without giving foreigners leave to increase the
price of theirs, by so much as the commodities
carried to them must be increased by our
taxes;—in the same manner as it is impossible in
the nature of things, to keep up interior consumption,
national consumption, <i>upon which depends
the payment of taxes</i>, without a general interior
increase in the price of labour, as well as in the
price of its products, when the wants of the State
require new contributions.</p>

<p>The second observation which I deem equally
essential, is, that such a work, (<i>a work of an utility
which may be called universal</i>) has been brought
about, consummated, without the Ministers of
any State whatsoever being entitled to any glory
from the event, except that of having facilitated
the operation, if they have favoured the
general liberty of communication in all articles
of trade; and without their having deserved any
other blame but that of retarding it, if their zeal,
their greediness for the <i>favourable balance</i>, has
suggested to them any <i>device</i> to attract and overthrow
it in the only country entrusted to their
management. We must universally ruin Credit,
Trade, Commerce, and the Banking business, if
we pretend to prevent Wealth from extending itself
universally, a little sooner or later. <i>The owner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
of any kind of riches whatever, has it not in his
power to do any thing else, but to choose the place,
the object, and the time, of giving the first motion</i>;
all the rest is merely the effect of a stone cast
into the water: observe how the undulations
succeed one another, how they are renewed
and extended;—can you fix the point where
they shall stop?—We pretend to direct them!—<i>Scilicet
is superûm labor est?</i> ... <i>Istæne animia
cœlestibus curæ?</i>—Indeed, indeed, too many
cares occupy the minds of our Gods!</p>

<p>I return to the grand points.</p>

<p>Methinks upon viewing the picture I have
drawn, it is easy now to conceive, why, as I
have observed in page 62, <i>a person, however
strongly convinced of the cruel effect which ought
naturally to arise from a debt of 64 millions sterling,
contracted from 1754 to 1762, could not nevertheless
cite in <span class="upright">England</span>, from 1763 to 1775, a
single indication of a decay in agriculture or commerce,
nor any falling-off in the enjoyment of
luxury, public or private, nor less insolence in the
bulk of the people</i>. The reason is this: the
two capitalists, who failed not to increase the
price of every thing they were concerned in, according
to the exigency of the taxes, determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
also (<i>after a few little formalities, always necessary
with regard to the people, when nothing but
luxury has been taxed</i>) to augment the price of
labour in proportion to that of its products;
foreigners, on the other hand, raised the price
of their goods in proportion as taxes had increased
the goods of <i>England</i> exported to them; and the
old equilibrium was restored every where, as
soon as the general increase of prices had made
the general power of consumption, equal to the
need the State was in of an exterior as well as
an interior, <i>i. e.</i> of a foreign as well as a national
consumption, in order that all the taxes might
be productive.</p>

<p>But if the debt of 64 millions, contracted
from 1754 to 1762, had increased, by 10 <i>per cent.</i>
the nominal value of all merchandise exported
from <i>England</i> since that period, how shall we
prevent the 60 millions of the last debt, from increasing,
from 8 to 10 <i>per cent.</i> the nominal value
of all commodities to be exported after this later
period?</p>

<p>And if the general augmentation of prices,
which has clearly followed the debt contracted
in <i>England</i> from 1754 to 1762, has proved advantageous
to all <i>Europe</i>, without hurting <i>England</i>,
why should not the general increase of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
prices, which results, and will inevitably result
from the last <i>English</i> debt, prove unprejudicial
to <i>England</i>, although it will prove advantageous
to all <i>Europe</i>?</p>

<p>But if this increase of 10 <i>per cent.</i> generally
acknowledged, in the price of all merchandise
in <i>Europe</i>, had extended only to the products of
industry; if the price of the total of the produce
of agriculture had not increased in the same
proportion;—<i>had not Nature always silently and
successfully opposed all the dreams of speculation on
this head, to what a degree of misery and wretchedness
would not agriculture have been reduced in all
parts of our so much enlightened <span class="upright">Europe</span>!</i>—It was
not so.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The quantity of wheat sold at <i>Berne</i> at 69
<i>batz</i>, on a medium of five years taken from 1751
to 1755, was sold for 92⅗ <i>batz</i> from 1766 to
1770.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>The quantity of wheat sold at <i>Dijon</i> at the
lowest, 2<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> on a medium of 5 years from
1753 to 1757, was sold at the lowest, 4<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
on a medium of 5 years from 1766 to 1770.</p>

<p>The quantity of wheat sold at <i>Bâle</i> for 9<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i>
on a medium of 5 years from 1754 to 1758, was
sold for 13<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> on a medium of 5 years from
1766 to 1770.</p>

<p>The quantity of wheat sold at <i>Geneva</i> for 27
<i>florins</i>, on a medium of 5 years from 1751 to
1755, was sold for 37 <i>florins</i>, on a medium of
5 years from 1766 to 1770, (see <i>Arthur Young</i>’s
Political Arithmetic.)</p>

<p>We find upon the total, from 1755 to 1770,
as I observed in my <i>Reflexions on a singular revolution
in France</i>, about 40 <i>per cent.</i> increase in
the price of wheat.—Ten <i>per cent.</i> was enough
to discharge, without expence to any body, and
without any attention being paid to it, the interest
of the debt contracted in <i>England</i>, from 1755 to
1762; but 30 <i>per cent.</i> more was necessary, in
order to come (without injuring <i>England</i>) nearly
to an equality with the <i>English</i> price, a price advantageous
to the agriculture of all <i>Europe</i>; an
advantageous price, which the <i>barriers</i> and barricadoes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
set up in <i>France</i>, had till then prevented
from extending to <i>Switzerland</i>.</p>

<p>The barriers having been removed, <i>Switzerland</i>
and <i>France</i> must necessarily have been enriched,
or <i>England</i> ruined:—<i>France</i> and <i>Switzerland</i>
were better pleased to be enriched; and so it
will necessarily happen after the removal of the
barriers subsisting between <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>,
that the agriculture of the latter must be enriched;—unless
she should choose to do herself a real
prejudice by keeping to all her former low
prices, in order to procure an imaginary advantage
to <i>Irish</i> industry, in hopes of prejudicing the
<i>British</i> manufacturer;—which would indeed be
very strange.</p>

<p>But if this proportionate augmentation in the
price of every thing,—as evident as it is necessary,—as
general as it is useful,—as natural as
it is little suspected,—in consequence of a national
debt contracted by a country trading
with all <i>Europe</i>,—getting rich by trading with
all <i>Europe</i>,—and who cannot get rich without
sharing her wealth with all <i>Europe</i>,—be
also a complete demonstration of the burden
being <span class="smcap">null</span>, so soon as the little private interests
have rendered it general, and no longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
permit the supposition of its being productive
of any other bad effects, but such as necessarily
result from a bad system of taxation; does the
point lie in rectifying the system, or in effecting
a reimbursement?—At least, is a tax to be
levied for the purpose of reimbursing, before we
have searched deep into <span class="smcap">the question the
most interesting to society that ever
was propounded</span>?</p>

<p>And in the supposition, that it should result
from the examination, as it does from my ideas,
<i>that there neither is, nor can be any real and lasting
harm in the taxes, but that which is the consequence
of a bad system of taxation</i>; as there is however
so much more harm done, at least of a transient
nature, as there are more taxes imposed, even in
the best manner,—would it not be necessary to
conclude, that loans bearing annuities, esteemed
the most advantageous to the State, (although
they always require an heavier, and sometimes
a double taxation), might have proved the most
pernicious and worst devised, <i>in any other circumstance
but that of a total discredit</i>, if they did not
now furnish the Sovereign with the means of redressing
what is most oppressive in the old taxes,
without imposing new ones?</p>

<p><i>I can sum up all that I have said hitherto,
by transcribing a couple of pages out of a pamphlet
written in <span class="upright">America</span> in the year 1774, laid before
the Academy of Sciences in 1778, and printed at
Paris in 1781. I should certainly be excusable had
I no other motive in this respect, than to prove that
my opinions are neither suggested by, nor depending
on circumstances. The reflexion contained in the
following quotation from that pamphlet, on the war
that broke out in 1779, is but a survey of the new
order of things, which would not have presented itself
to my mind, had it not been in my power, even
then, to have published in several large volumes,
that which I now comprise within three hundred and
some pages, in order to render its perusal less laborious

<p>“All the mystery of society, consists in

are in possession of all, and the <i>pilferers</i> who
are in possession of nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>“This division operates of itself, by shackling,

that is to say, by obstructing, as little as possible,
communications of all kinds.</p>

<p>“This division is inseparable from the greatest
possible quantity of productions and consumptions,
which cannot be effected but by
the greatest number of <i>productors</i> and consumers,

<p><i>When a man has shewn himself capable of looking
upon a war as the readiest means that could
conduce to a general union of interests, no one will
be surprised if that very man should allow to
luxury the principal honour in the accomplishment
of such a prophecy. Nor would any one be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
if he were to add, that the rage for luxury,
in a discerning despot, would soon lead him to
establish within his dominions the greatest freedom,
from which alone he can expect the greatest display
of all kinds of luxury, the choice and first fruits of
which would be always at his command. Nor
again would any one be surprised were the prophet
to add, that wherever luxury should be at its summit,
none but the idle would be at a loss for a
livelihood, and that not a mean one; that even
the idiot, as well as the worn-out labourer, would
find there, under the designation of a <span class="upright">hospital</span>,
an asylum equal to the habitation of a King:—The
habitation of the Kings of Great Britain is
not comparable to some of her hospitals.</i></p>

<p>Would not the question about luxury, reduced
to its elements, like those other questions
which I have touched upon hitherto, present
consequences diametrically opposite to those
ideas which perhaps are yet too common, only
because they have not been thoroughly examined?
Methinks I have advanced one step
towards the solution of the problem, by proving
(if I have proved it) that the tax laid on that
pretended monster, Luxury, is in fact the most
oppressive for the people, on account of the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
effects, from which the impost cannot be
freed.</p>

<p>First, If that tax lessens the consumption of the
article taxed, provision must be made, by a fresh
tax, for the <i>deficit</i> in the first, which nevertheless
has already deprived of sustenance, those
who derived it only from that article of consumption
annihilated by the tax.</p>

<p>Secondly, If the rage for the article taxed,
gets the better of the rigour of the tax, or in other
words, of the absurd disproportion thereby established
between the real and nominal value of
that article, the land proprietor has no other resource
left, whereby to provide for the tax, and
for the rest of his standing expences, than to raise
the prices of his commodities accordingly; and
the poor, whose consumption has not been taxed,
pays dearer, nevertheless, for his bread, and for
all that he consumes besides, whilst the tax laid
on luxury alone, is pleaded by all the <i>capitalists</i>
as a pretence for not increasing the price of labour
amongst the people they employ.</p>

<p>Thirdly, If the little private calculations, of
which I have spoken, did not rectify (as I contend
they do by degrees, and as they ought to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
sooner) the mistakes of the grand calculations in
the administration of finances; that is to say, if
the land proprietor did not increase the price of
his commodities, in proportion as the tax bears
heavy on that article of luxury which he still
persists to consume: it would appear still more
heinous in the eyes of the moralist; for those
artificers who, without remorse, without a blush,
should employ themselves in the work of <i>Satan</i>,
of which the consumption should continue the
same, would subsist undisturbed in peace and
plenty on that very work, whilst a considerable
number of scrupulous artisans, employed hitherto
on articles free from censure, but of which the consumption
should have decreased by the counter-blow
of the taxes on luxury, would most scandalously
be left starving and unemployed.</p>

<p>I shall now inspect the question more minutely;
for all I have said hitherto is not so much
an apology for luxury, as an exposition of the inconveniences
attending its being made the principal
object of taxation: I beg to be excused, if
I grow unwillingly more familiar in my style,
when the dignity of the subject seems to require
one of suitable dignity in the manner of
treating it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p>It is the quality of the land that determines
the division of its products: however ungrateful
the soil, the man who cultivates it, first deducts
what is necessary for his subsistence, and a trifle
more; the rest is divided amongst the landlord
and some others, for one reason or another admitted
to a share. This division, determined
by the most general quality of the land, brings
down the proprietor, who farms out his estate,
to about one third of its productions, and reduces
nearly to the like proportion, those who
are employed in wresting them from the bottom
of the earth.</p>

<p>In order therefore to consume as much as 80
men, the proprietor must have a landed estate
capable of giving food to 240; and out of these
240, 160 must be provided for before the proprietor
can think on his own consumption. Consequently,
it would be unreasonable to call him
to any other account than for that portion which
he has received: but I readily subscribe to the
necessity of having that account examined with
the utmost rigour, since the object is to justify the
dissipation of so considerable a surplus, and since
the employment of that surplus, well ascertained,
will give us sufficient light on the employment
of the other parts of the revenue, which by that
means it will be useless to examine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>The highest pitch of extravagance, in point of
luxury, is, beyond contradiction, that which, in
the smallest possible compass, contains the largest
quantity, as well as the greatest perfection of
labour, and of a labour the most easy to destroy.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a man who, to the fancy of
being possessed of such an article, should join
that of seeing constantly at work all those hands
which must be employed to complete it; such a
fancy never produces any other effect, but that
of tertiating or doubling the price of things.
The Patriarchs of old, busied and amused themselves,
no doubt, in setting to work those whom
they enabled to eat; they lived too near the time
when man was condemned to labour, to maintain
them in idleness. The modern Patriarch
of whom I am speaking, provided with a pound
weight of flax, which costs him 6<i>d.</i> divides it
among 25 working people, who give it every
preparation necessary to answer the purpose it is
intended for. After an entire month of the most
slavish precautions, the most minute details, a
thread, hardly perceptible to the naked eye,
presents to the warm imagination of the proprietor,
the idea of the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of which
this thread is to be the foundation; after 4
or 5 months more, devoted to the most patient
and assiduous industry, he is at last put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
in possession of some slips of lace, weighing in
all 4 or 5 drachms, picked out and sorted, thanks
to the last refinement of art, from that pound of
flax which had cost six-pence. Five-pence three
farthings, and a few fractions, are then, it seems,
in the strictest calculation, the only real loss—the
only devastation which is occasioned by
luxury carried to the highest pitch of extravagance;
and this loss is compensated by some very
curious pieces of workmanship, which it is impossible
to value at less than 227<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> being
the amount of 4550 days work at 12<i>d.</i> paid to
each of the 25 working people, who have owed
their subsistence, for six months, to that pretended
inutility.—Amongst all the passions with
which Providence has been pleased to gratify
the rich for the advantage of the poor, name
me only one that occasions less devastation, and
maintains a greater number of indigent persons,
than luxury carried to excess. O ye rigid men,
who have left off wearing lace, join with me
who have left it off too,—join with me in teaching
those who continue to wear it, how many
of their brethren they nourish without knowing
it! Make them virtuous by teaching them, that
in order to be so, they need only do, from a sentiment
of humanity, what hitherto perhaps they
have done through a motive of puerile vanity, or
from a principle of ostentation, which, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
considered, needs to be considered with some
indulgence.</p>

<p>Another aspect, whimsical enough perhaps,
but by no means foreign to the title of this pamphlet,
would be that under which we should view
those prodigies of art and patience, as the work
not only of 25 artificers who were busied upon
it for six months, but also of 12 or 15 husbandmen
whose existence and labour were indispensable
for the sustenance, during the same time,
of the 25 labouring people employed in that
great work.... A peevish man would perhaps
exclaim, <i>Was it indeed worth while to be born,
if all ends with this life?</i>—And yet, even in this
case, thread-lace ought not to be proscribed:
it was not worth while indeed to come into the
world, solely to make lace; but, once born, we
must work at something, in order to bear, without
weariness, every instant even of a life which
should not require lace-making for its support:
as to the nature of the work, let us not find
fault with that of others, before we justly estimate
our own.... Can we find many of our fellow-creatures,
who on their death-bed are able to shew
the work of their whole life ... worth the
smallest shred of lace then in being?</p>

<p>After this single instance of luxury, by which
25 men are fed during six months at the expence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
of another, by daily reducing his revenue from
80 to 55, I think that, without being an enthusiast
or a declaimer, it would be difficult, even
for a good man in the right sense of the word,
to withstand the pleasure (although perhaps
rather of the mischievous kind) of observing
that little more is wanted beyond two such fancies
as we have stated, to bring the Proprietor, reduced
in the origin from 240 shillings to 80, and
then from 80 to 55—to bring him, I say, exactly
to the level of the cultivator, whom he
has brought down to 9<i>d.</i> or 10<i>d.</i> and of the
mechanic on whom he has bestowed 11 or 12<i>d.</i>;
however, I am willing to allow him 24 for his real,
personal, and daily consumption. Twenty-four
pence! will it be said, <i>What signifies being so rich,
to consume so little</i>! Yes, twenty-four pence;
and this is by much too much, if we deduct, as
we ought, from the price of each article supposed
to be consumed by the rich, the sum that remains
in the hands of the pilferers of all kinds,
who stand, unknown to him, between him and
that article.—<i>How! what say you then to that
plate of green-peas which costs 6, 8, or 10 guineas!</i>—But,
my good friend the consumer of
green peas, if you knew how many pilferers
it conceals, of whom you have not the least
idea! if you knew how many wants it has supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
to some, how many indulgences of luxury
it has procured to others, before it found
its way to the table of an Epicure, or of an ostentatious
man!—Let us try to enumerate them:
workers of mines and quarries, masons, carpenters,
glaziers, colliers, lock-smiths, <i>English</i> and
<i>French</i> sailors for the common-spice trade; <i>Dutch</i>
seamen, for the more precious kinds; ships of war
of the three Powers, indispensable for the protection
of the merchantmen employed on those
objects; wood-fellers in <i>Sweden</i>, sail-cloth weavers
in <i>Russia</i>, ship-builders, pilots, admirals of
the three nations, husbandmen busied in the
four parts of the world in procuring food for
themselves, in order to prepare food for all those
wood-fellers, glaziers, admirals, &amp;c. exclusive
of the <i>Dutch</i> gardener, and the <i>French</i> cook
who alone can worthily crown the mighty operation.—Imagination
loses itself in that single plate
of green peas. How many reductions from 16
pence to 8, and from 8 to 4, have been required to
produce it! It is inconceivable that it should not
sell for more than 6 or 8 guineas;—but if each of
those pilferers above mentioned takes back
the small portion by which he has increased the
intrinsic value of the article.... O ye, who must
have swallowed up 500 <i>properties</i>, in order to
eat, without being guilty of extravagance, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
plate of green peas, and who flatter yourselves
with the idea of having consumed on that day fifty
or sixty crowns worth, learn and reflect henceforward,
without remorse and without vanity,
that you have not spent above half one penny, the
real value of any other dish of greens which you
might have substituted to the peas you have consumed.</p>

<p>Scrutinise, in the same manner, your wearing
apparel; choose, like a child, what pleases most
the eyes of the body; or, like a fastuous man, all
that is most imposing to the eyes of the imagination;
or, miser-like, that which costs least money;
or, in fine, like a man of sense, what your
means or your taste incline you to wear; the
difference, as to essentials, is little or none.
It cannot be positively asserted, that your consumption
will be more or less considerable in
one than in the other case; but recollect that
thread lace, for which you could not pay less
than 227<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> because there stand between
you and the pound of flax from which it has
been extracted, 35 or 40 intermediate pilferers,
to be fed during six months;—this lace,
however, in spite of that extravagant price,
could not, as you have seen, be set down to account
amongst the articles of your real and personal
consumption, for more than sixpence, supposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
to be the intrinsic value of a pound weight of
flax, which has gone through so many hands to
be converted into lace. Now, on this principle,
you might be wrapped in lace from head to foot:
and your entire <i>mummy</i>, instead of presenting to
the eye of a sworn appraiser a consumption of 30
or 40,000<i>l.</i> would in this instant of its highest
splendor, only present him with a devastation of
200<i>lb.</i> of flax, sacrificed to decorate that mummy,
or to hide its defects.—And as the object would
be 200<i>lb.</i> of flax, the value of which is fully
known by the number of people to whom it
would afford support, instead of dealing so lightly
as I did with a single pound, when I introduced
my Patriarch, the appraiser would reckon
with you rigorously; he would consider, that
in the hands of the Arts, no part of the works of
the creation can be lost; that, as it is their
triumph, so it is their duty, to divide into 10,
20, or 30 parts, whatever requires such a division,
in order that each may receive the degree of
utility of which it is susceptible, and which the
Arts are bound to account for to society: the appraiser
would then carry you to the lace-merchant,
in order to lay before you ten different sorts of an
inferior lace, taken from parts chosen successively
after that which serves you for a wrapper, and
descending still from pilfery to pilfery, he
would at last inveigle you into the cabins of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
pretended wretch, where he would shew you the
quantity of coarse and substantial shirts, necessary
to teach you that 3 or 4 <i>lb.</i> of flax, at the most,
are the only possible devaluations your mummy can
be reproached with, as two shillings are the only
expence your vanity can boast of in the 25 or
30,000<i>l.</i> which you could presume to have consumed.</p>

<p>Yet, let us grant something to the pretended
importance of being possessed of 500 <i>properties</i>,
each of them sufficient to the support of one man.
I shall accordingly suppose you to be habitually
cloathed in those stuffs, which, to the richness of
the materials that compose them, join the perfection
of workmanship, (which concerns you, as
you have seen, in no other light, but that of either
a benevolent, or an unintentional provider for the
necessary consumption of the labouring man);—but
10 <i>lb.</i> of silk, as they come out of Nature’s
hands, are not worth 30 shillings:—without
enquiring why they may then be valued at 30
shillings, bring all the other parts of your dress
to the touchstone I have furnished you with;
consider, that if you wear the same coat every
day, it would be far from being worn out
at the end of the year,—and how far it would
be of course from standing for two or three
pence in the account of your daily consumption;—add<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
thereto your real and personal wastings in
coals, wood, pomatum, essences, elixirs, &amp;c.
<i>valued after the same principle</i>;—at what a distance
you still remain from the 24 pence I have
granted you for consumption!—And do not say
that you renew your coat every season;—had you
swallowed up 5000 instead of 500 <i>properties</i>,
and should you change cloaths every day, your
real consumption would not be the greater for
it: would not your <i>valet de chambre</i>, to whom
you should have given that suit of cloaths, for
which you had paid 40 guineas, and which you had
worn only once—would not, I say, your <i>valet de
chambre</i> sell it for 15 guineas to an old cloaths-man,
who would get 20<i>l.</i> for it from a strolling player?—Be
pleased now to trace that suit from <i>Paris</i> to
<i>Lisle</i>, to <i>Brussels</i>, <i>Dresden</i>, <i>Poland</i>, <i>Russia</i>; see how
many people will get a livelihood by carrying it
about; how many guineas it will bring to the
travelling <i>Roscius</i>, who will shine in so many
countries at your expence; reflect, on the revolutions
which the elegance of that dress will occasion
in the modes at <i>Petersburgh</i>; how many
draughtsmen, embroiderers, working people of all
sorts, will be employed and fed, (<i>thanks to your
luxury</i>), in copying that master-piece of taste and
fancy.—This is not all; you might probably, at
the end of 15 years, meet again in <i>Paris</i> with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
same suit, cut into small pieces, in the hands of
some ladies of the first rank, busily engaged in
unweaving the rags, to send, as soon as possible,
those precious relics of your seemingly spoiled
cloaths, to <i>Lyons</i>, &amp;c. where ten workmen are
waiting its arrival, to get bread by restoring
to it a great part of its former value, under
another form.—And you would presume to have
consumed it?... The work of God is not so
easily destroyed, nor his beneficence so easily concentered.</p>

<h3><i>Was it worth being so rich, to consume so little?</i></h3>

<p>Were you to say, <i>Is it worth while to commit
an injustice in order to grow rich, when we can
consume but so little, and when the means are so numerous
of pilfering so lawfully all that is wanted for
consumption?</i> I could then understand you;—but
since you are in possession of 500 <i>properties</i>
without having been guilty of injustice, it is
something to reflect that they are really to you,
the source of numberless enjoyments which you
have it in your power to render worthy of a rational
being: and, as the continuance of those
enjoyments depends entirely on the health and
bodily strength of so many others who are to
contribute thereto, it is something to be conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
that we find our own pleasures in the interest
of others; it is something to reflect, that
these pleasures are a very gentle mean, devised
most probably by an universal <i>Watchfulness</i>, to
induce you to provide men destitute of every
thing, with that <i>modicum</i> of goods which was not
granted to them, and which, nevertheless, being
necessary for their sustenance, is sufficient to
their moderation, and prevents their feeling the
privation of all the rest: it is something to reflect,
that you feed in fact 50, 100, 500 perhaps of
your brethren, amongst whom there are 10, 15,
30, as well fed as yourself, since they live on
what comes from your table. As to the others,
whose faces you will never see, since some of
them are at <i>Pekin</i>, in <i>Arabia</i>, at <i>Constantinople</i>,
and others in <i>France</i>, <i>Russia</i>, &amp;c. be assured
that, with much less meat than you, but more
bread, potatoes, or rice, and a few glasses of
an acid liquor, the idea of which, whilst I
venture to speak of it, is enough to crisp all
your nerves, they are as contented, as happy as
you, because they consume, without any reflection,
without any solicitude for the morrow,
all they want, in order to view that morrow
with the same tranquillity.—Would it not be
unjust in that Being, <i>who weigheth the mountains
in a balance</i>, if there were, amongst men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
one condition more unfortunate than another?
Would he not be unjust, if amongst men, there
were one condition more blessed than another? I
suppose, indeed, that there exists a Being, <i>who
weigheth the mountains in a balance</i>, as others
have supposed that there is a future life, where
happiness is more visibly equal; and I have
hitherto ventured upon so many suppositions!—yet
I would beg leave to offer one more, relating
though indirectly perhaps to the object
now under consideration; but this shall be the
last: I will ask (upon the supposition that
there really exists a Being, not only Estimator,
Moderator, but Creator also of all that
thinks, wishes, and can be happy) ... yes,
I presume to ask, whether the created being, capable
of conceiving the idea of giving immortality
to the creature capable of wishing for it,
of fostering the hopes, and feeling the value of
it, would not be greater than the Creator himself,
if the Creator had not conceived such an
idea?—I freely confess, that I should think
myself better than the Creator, had the Creator
conceived such an idea without putting it in
execution.</p>

<p>I now return to the point which requires no
kind of supposition, I mean the real consumption.—Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
us pass from that very insignificant
possessor of 500 <i>properties</i>, to the greatest Monarch
upon earth.—What difference is there
between his consumption and that of the meanest
of his subjects?—He has the choice of
every thing, such is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of his
power: three, four, or five pounds weight of
nourishing food, are really as sufficient for the
one as they are necessary to the other;—and on
all points, what is the object that procures to the
Monarch either advantage or pleasure, the price
of which as paid by him, <i>were it even of fourfold
the value</i>, is not exactly composed, both of
the amount of the sustenance that was necessary
to the production of that object, and of a sum
which will infallibly pay for other productions,
which must be purchased to forward new ones—<i>from
which the people will constantly have deducted
their necessaries, before they are permitted to satisfy
the superfluities, the luxury of any whosoever</i>?—Such
is that never-ending screw, that adorable
chain, which nothing can stop or break, unless
it be the insanity of a monster, who should receive
that fourfold price, and bury it under
ground, lest it should prove useful to society.—That
wretch was very consistent with his feelings,
who wished the <i>Roman</i> people to have but
one head, that he might exterminate the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
nation at a single blow; but the phœnix will
ever rise from its ashes; and Humanity, with
all her resources, all her rights, would be reproduced
from the very stones, were it possible
that not a single head should escape the sword of
that <i>consistent being</i> who might wish to cut them
all off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading41"><i>Thoughts on the Colonies.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The question concerning luxury leads to the
investigation of some ideas on the Colonies; I
do not mean that of taxing them, either in a
direct or indirect manner, for the reason truly
specious, that the wars undertaken for their protection,
having loaded the nation with taxes to
an enormous amount, it is but just that they
should come in for a share of the burden.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that a national debt
contracted, no matter for what, occasioning in
every thing an indispensable increase of price,
the Colonies pay their quota of such a debt (notwithstanding
the drawbacks) when they purchase
goods at the rate to which the said debt has
advanced them: it must also have been noticed,
even how necessary it was that the price of commodities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
from the Colonies should increase in
proportion to the price of those of the Mother-country,
in order that the former might be able
to answer that advance of prices, without hurting
the two essential points, consumption and
re-production; whence it follows, that if new
taxes are introduced, <i>either directly or indirectly</i>,
to defray their pretended proportion in the interest
of the national debt, neither harm nor good
will result, <i>if the price of their commodities be
increased in the same proportion</i>; but that if they be
taxed, without that increase in the price of their
commodities, they will consume by so much less
of national goods <i>or of foreign ones paid for in national
merchandise</i>, that is, to the amount of the
sum which the tax shall have taken from them:
this point is evident. Thus it is, that after the
war in 1755, all <i>Europe</i> was obliged, as has been
shewn, to increase her prices, so as to put them on
a level with those in <i>England</i>; and had not <i>Great
Britain</i> submitted to that reciprocal advance, and
all the rest of <i>Europe</i> condescended to receive
only, for the 13 <i>effective</i> millions of their own
goods, the 13 <i>nominal</i> millions of that quantity
of <i>English</i> commodities which was worth 14, on
account of the taxes only, the nominal million
which would have remained in the hands of
<i>England</i>, would have been without value, <i>and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
no longer reproduced for want of consumption, for
want of means to pay for it, and to encourage such
a reproduction</i>.</p>

<p>I think also that it is useless to examine whether
the colonies can add any thing to the real
power of a nation, since, in order to be convinced
of the very reverse, it is enough to
observe, that if 2 or 300 ships mounting from
10 to 120 guns be required, in order to protect
effectually an extent of between 1500 and
2000 leagues of <i>colonial</i> coasts, distant 1000,
1500, nay 4000 leagues from the mother-country,
the 100,000 men employed in time of
war, on those floating citadels, are always furnished
by the Metropolis, and do not in any manner
exempt her either from erecting those permanent
citadels which must be scattered along the
coasts of the mother-country, or from providing
the number of men necessary to defend
them in case of an invasion. In this point of
view, the colonies would therefore rather diminish
than increase the national power.</p>

<p>On the other hand, experience has just taught
us, that as soon as those very colonies, for
which it is pretended so much blood has been
spilt, and so much money wasted, are in a situation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
to stand up in their own defence, there is no
depending upon them, but inasmuch as they
are on the footing of allies; and interest alone
fixes the duration of every alliance.</p>

<p>The above three objects deserve not, methinks,
any further dissertation: the question that merits
a more particular scrutiny, is that which
concerns the utility of those very colonies, when
their weakness is a pledge of their fidelity.</p>

<p>That utility consists in securing to the mother-country,
1st, an exclusive mart for such goods
as she thinks proper to export there; and 2dly,
the exclusive sale of the returns, in which, it
is said, she finds a compensation for the expence
she is at to carry her goods to that market.</p>

<p>I shall investigate, under various points of
view, all relative to those two objects, the
utility of those colonies whose commerce is
fully ascertained, before I speak of any other;
and I shall only draw the necessary inferences
from the most incontrovertible facts.</p>

<p class="center"><i>1st.</i></p>

<p>We find in the Statements of Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>,
that the exports from <i>England</i> to the colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
whose independence can no longer be
disputed, amounted annually, upon a medium of
5 years, taken from 1769 to 1773, to the sum
of 2,491,230<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Now the two wars of 1739 and 1755, undertaken,
it is said, for the protection of those colonies,
that is, <i>to preserve</i> to the mother-country
<i>the monopoly of them</i>, have cost <i>Great Britain</i>
99,141,625<i>l.</i>; and these 99 millions, though
the interest has been reduced as often as possible,
still cost <i>England</i> annually 3,500,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>It is then a sum of 3,500,000<i>l.</i> which, even
so early as the year 1762, <i>England</i> had resolved
to pay annually, in order to preserve, and the
better to secure to herself the exclusive privilege
of exporting annually to <i>North-America</i>, <i>European</i>
goods to the amount of 2,491,230<i>l.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>2dly.</i></p>

<p>The imports from those colonies into <i>Great
Britain</i>, upon a medium of the said 5 years, did
not exceed the sum of 1,208,665<i>l.</i>—<i>Great Britain</i>,
therefore, has enjoyed during the space of
5 years, a pretended balance of 1,282,565<i>l.</i>
against those colonies;—but is that glorious balance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
any thing more than the advantage of
having given to those colonies, in the space of
5 years, a credit in the sum of 6,412,825<i>l.</i> supposing
that such sum was the amount of her
claims in that part of <i>America</i>, or of the half, if
in fact half only of that sum remained due to her,
notwithstanding the enormous appearance in Sir
<i>Charles Whitworth</i>’s Statements?</p>

<p class="center"><i>3dly.</i></p>

<p>If the colonies, now independent, will henceforth
call in all the other nations of <i>Europe</i> to a
share in the advantage of crediting them in the
same manner, can it be supposed that <i>England</i>
will not find in <i>Europe</i>, some other nation
willing to receive that part of the <i>English</i> credit,
which the independent colonies shall no longer
think proper to make use of? In this case, can
any thing more be required, on the part of
<i>England</i>, than to manufacture in less quantity
such goods as suit only the inhabitants of <i>America</i>,
and somewhat more of those that may suit
the different nations of <i>Europe</i>; and to this first
operation to add the complaisance of receiving
a greater quantity of their goods than she has
imported hitherto?—In this case likewise, what
ruinous consequences could <i>England</i> experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
by exporting her goods to her neighbours, instead
of sending them to <i>America</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>4thly.</i></p>

<p>If the complaints set up by <i>England</i> against the
United States, are grounded only on their incapacity
of making returns proportionate to the
value of the goods exported there since the peace,
are the United States to blame if <i>European</i> cupidity
has exported to <i>America</i>, in the space of six
months, as much as its inhabitants could consume
and pay for in two years? Does such an event,
almost infallibly the result of a long interruption
of correspondence, prove any thing more than
the necessity of a balance between production
and consumption, the advantage of knowing as
soon as possible the difference from the one to the
other, the inconvenience of a trade, in which we
lose sight of our capital for whole years together,
and the advantage of a trade which would 5 or 6
months after return to the hands of the <i>capitalist</i>
the stock he had laid out?</p>

<p class="center"><i>5thly.</i></p>

<p>Had even those colonies remained in, or returned
to a state of subjection to <i>England</i>, would
not the same interruption of correspondence have
been productive of the same inconvenience?—During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
the war, which terminated by the treaty
of <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>, all the <i>French</i> colonies had
remained under the dominion of <i>France</i>, and yet
during all the first, and great part of the second
year of peace most of the <i>French</i> goods were sold
at <i>Martinique</i> and <i>St. Domingo</i>, 15 and 20 <i>per
cent.</i> below the prime cost in <i>Europe</i>;—between
dependent and independent colonies, then, in this
respect, who can perceive a shadow of difference?</p>

<p class="center"><i>6thly.</i></p>

<p>If the <i>English</i> merchants, after having over-stocked
the <i>American</i> markets with <i>European</i>
goods, have attempted to strip <i>America</i> of the
little money she had to boast of, and to leave her
goods on her own hands, do the complaints set
up in <i>England</i> on this subject, prove any thing
essential either to <i>England</i>, or to the rest of the
world, more than the impossibility of carrying into
execution beyond a certain degree, the plan, as
destructive as it is absurd, of any other trade but
that which is founded on a reciprocity of advantages,
on <i>an exchange of the gifts with which
Nature and Art have favoured one country,
against those with which Nature and Art have
favoured another country</i>? And even, upon a
supposition, that <i>America</i> should have returned
under the domination of <i>England</i>, if the <i>English</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
merchants had, in this case, attempted to wrest
from her the little money she was possessed of,
would not the <i>American</i> colonists have been
justified in taking every measure necessary to preserve
it?—Would they in enforcing that right
have been free from the misfortune, common to
mankind, of always doing, in order to guard
against an injury, much more than is either just
or necessary?—The impossibility of making returns
adequate to the extravagant invoices sent
by the <i>French</i> traders to their colonies in <i>America</i>,
after the war I have mentioned, determined also
the agents of the <i>French</i> trade to strip those colonies
of all the money they could lay their hands
upon: no other way to put a stop to that spoliation
was left, but to bore in the middle of their
dollars a large hole, which restoring the equilibrium
between the rapacity of the foreign
trader, and the wants of the interior commerce,
preserved within those colonies the trifling sum in
specie that still remained there. Soon after, the
equilibrium was also restored between the imports
and the consumption; and from that instant
an end was put to the thirst after money, as
well as to the necessity of boring the dollars.—What
difference then can exist, in this respect
also, between a colony and a free State?</p>

<p class="center"><i>7thly.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<p>All the exports from <i>England</i> to the colonies,
the monopoly of which she has preserved by the
peace, (including her trade to <i>India</i>) amounted,
in 1773, to 2,430,420<i>l.</i> (for the details see Sir
<i>Charles Whitworth</i>). Now the annual expence
of the <i>British</i> navy, and its accessaries, considering
the increase in that of <i>France</i>, must be, at
present, or will be soon, 2,000,000<i>l.</i> May it
not be fairly concluded, that <i>England</i> is about
to pay the annual sum of 2 millions sterling,
in order to maintain herself in the exclusive
privilege of carrying annually to the distance of
1500, of 2000, of 4 or 6000 leagues, the value
of 2,432,420<i>l.</i> in <i>European</i> goods?—And would
not that privilege be dearly bought, were not
<i>France</i> to lay out annually likewise 45 millions
of livres <i>tournois</i>, in protecting her privileged
exportation?</p>

<p class="center"><i>8thly</i>,</p>

<p>I have at present before my eyes no other standard,
whereby to estimate the exportation of <i>France</i>
to her sugar-colonies, than that of <i>England</i> to hers;
that exportation amounted, in 1773, to 197,236<i>l.</i>
But the population of the <i>French</i> colonies is
far from being in a treble proportion to that of
the <i>English</i> colonies, and luxury is equal in both;
yet let us suppose that the amount of the exports
from <i>France</i> to her colonies, including those she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
sends to <i>India</i>, be annually 80 millions <i>tournois</i>.—The
interest of the national debt in <i>France</i>
is 202 millions <i>tournois</i>, (see <i>Administration des
Finances de la France</i>) one half, or rather three
fourths of which have been incurred for the protection
of her establishments in those parts of the
world.—May it not be said, that <i>France</i> is at the
yearly expence of 150 millions <i>tournois</i>, independently
of the 45 millions for her navy, for the
purpose of maintaining herself in the exclusive
privilege of exporting every year the value of
80 millions <i>tournois</i>, in <i>European</i> goods, to her
possessions in <i>India</i> and <i>America</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>9thly</i>,</p>

<p>All the <i>European</i> exports, carried by <i>England</i>
in the year 1773, either to <i>India</i>, <i>Africa</i>,
or <i>America</i>, including the exports for which she
held an exclusive privilege in the part of <i>America</i>
now independent, amounted to 4,975,192<i>l.</i> we
shall say 5 millions:—if you value at 10 millions
of the same currency, the exports of all the other
nations of <i>Europe</i> to those parts of the world, we
shall find a capital of 15 millions sterling in
goods annually exported from <i>Europe</i>:—but the
yearly expence of a navy, which cannot be dispensed
with for the protection of those exports,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
is valued at 8 millions sterling, 4 of which fall
to the share of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>Exclusive of those 8 millions sterling, the interest
paid by <i>England</i> to acquire, preserve, and
protect that part of <i>European</i> exports that concerns
her, amounts to about 6,500,000<i>l.</i> including
that of the last war; the interest paid by
<i>France</i>, comes nearly to the same sum; the interest
paid by <i>Spain</i> could not be computed, were
the depopulation of that country to be taken into
the account; but estimate them at 4 millions,
including those which other <i>European</i> nations
have sacrificed to the same Idol: let us say
nothing about <i>Holland</i>, who for many years
(except the few last) has made some figure
<i>Europe</i>, only by her good luck in alleviating
the distresses of others, her sole motive for which
was her own advantage: and we shall sum up,
at last, an annual expenditure of 25 millions
sterling, in interest and naval expences, incurred
by <i>Europe</i>, in order to preserve the exclusive
privilege, 1st, of exporting every year 15
millions sterling in <i>European</i> goods to her colonies,
both in <i>India</i> and <i>America</i>; and, 2dly, of
establishing in those colonies <i>the system of government
best calculated to prevent that exportation
from becoming more considerable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>10thly</i>,</p>

<p>We have observed, that the exports from
<i>England</i> to the colonies of <i>America</i>, and to <i>India</i>,
amounted, in 1773, to 4,900 and some thousand
pounds sterling, suppose 5 millions: now her
importation of commodities from those various
countries is about 5,900,000<i>l.</i> (see Sir <i>Charles
Whitworth</i>); but we have also noticed, that she
left yearly in <i>North America</i> 1,282,000<i>l.</i> more
than she received therefrom. This matter, considered
in the most favourable light, that is, as a
balance of trade, ought to be added to the former;
and the whole together will give us a total
of 7 millions, shewing an annual benefit of 2
millions some hundred thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>It appears then, that an annual benefit of 2
millions some hundred thousand pounds sterling
costs <i>England</i> annually 6,500,000<i>l.</i> interest for
her debt, and 2 millions for the support of her
navy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>11thly</i>,</p>

<p>We have seen, that the annual and general exportation
of <i>European</i> goods to <i>America</i> and <i>India</i>
amounted to about 15 millions sterling.—If
5 millions of <i>English</i> exports return no more than
2 millions some hundred thousand pounds annual
benefit to <i>England</i>, that <i>England</i>, who sets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
the highest price on her goods of all kinds, the
general exportation of 15 millions, to which
<i>England</i> contributes only one third, cannot, of
course, afford to the whole of <i>Europe</i>, a profit of
above 6 millions and some hundred thousand
pounds;—but it seems that a benefit of 6 millions
and some hundred thousand pounds is dearly
bought at the rate of 25 millions laid out annually
by <i>Europe</i>, both in paying the interest of
their respective national debts, and for the support
of the <i>European</i> navies designed to preserve, protect,
and secure such a benefit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>12thly</i>,</p>

<p>If it were very true, as it is to this day asserted,
that those 25 millions of annual and indisputable
expenditure, are in reality so many yearly
losses to the nations who sustain it, might it not
be reasonably concluded, would it not be impossible
not to conclude, that all the colonies of
<i>Europe</i> were established only for her ruin?—If
we only attend to the last war, which in fact loads
the different nations who took a share in it,
with an annual interest of 9 or 10 millions,—9
or 10 millions to be paid every year, partly to
preserve the right, partly to obtain the permission
of exporting <i>European</i> commodities into a country,
of which the inhabitants, besides their own
importation, consume annually to the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
only 2,491,230<i>l.</i> of those same commodities which
are exported to them by others—who (to assume
the trader’s phrase) cannot clear by that exportation,
a greater annual profit than 3, 4, or even
500,000<i>l.</i>! ... it seems indeed that one cannot
see without surprise and concern, the shocking
disproportion between the end proposed, and the
sole means of obtaining it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>13thly</i>,</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, it be true, as I maintain it
to be, that after the peace, when a perfect equilibrium
is restored to every thing, the 9 or 10 millions
interest of the national debt, has no other
effect but that of <span class="smcap">adding to every thing a
nominal value which injures no one,
though it may be advantageous to many;
a nominal value, which, in every state,
proportions itself, first to the sum of its
revenue compared to that of its debt,
and soon after to the difference which
the debt contracted by the nation called
the most loaded, and which, in fact, is only
the greatest exporter, has produced in
that enormous quantity of the goods she
exports</span>;—if it appear more reasonable to adopt
that idea, than to give up a trade, which, without
that very idea, would prove the most absurd, as
well as the most destructive that human genius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
could invent, (<i>the alternative seems to be forcibly
established</i>);—in this case the regret will be heart-felt,
when we consider the loss of men sacrificed
during the last war: but if from this general aggregate
of truths little suspected, and much less
reflected upon, there should result a system of Politics
in <i>Europe</i>, of Administration in her different
States, of Government in her Colonies, which
should procure to <i>Europe</i>, at the least expence, the
greatest exportation of that of which she has a superabundance,
and the greatest importation of
that in which she is deficient ... then indeed, then,
might we find consolation for the evil, in adverting
to its consequences.—And, upon this principle,
what can <i>England</i> have suffered by losing
her sovereignty over <i>America</i>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>14thly</i>,</p>

<p>The contagion of example has been apprehended.
Let us suppose the fact. What then
would be the loss sustained by <i>Europe</i>? None, I
believe, unless the consequence of the general independency
of the colonies, should be that they
would give up <i>European</i> commodities they have
been used to, and which they can so readily procure
by means of a multitude of other articles, which
would be of no value to them were they not calculated
to procure them those <i>European</i> commodities
which they are in the habit of consuming.—But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
beg leave to ask, what purpose could their independence
answer?—It appears to me, they could
not think of it without a palpable folly; and that
it is impossible they should think of it, <i>without
that kind of vexation which brings a man to the necessity
of choosing between two extremes</i>.—Another
consideration, which tends to make <i>Europe</i> easy,
at least in regard to the colonies situated beyond
the tropic, is, that no rivalship can subsist between
them and their mother-countries in any
thing that concerns the soil and industry.</p>

<p>In regard to the productions of the soil, all
that part of <i>America</i> inclosed within even the
30th degree of north, and the 30th degree of south
latitude, could not yield, without double and
treble expence, any thing that can be produced
in <i>Europe</i>, and in the other part of <i>America</i>, from
the 30th degree to the pole. And, on the other
hand, at what an amazing expence must all <i>Europe</i>,
jointly with that part of <i>America</i> now independent,
produce, even in a kind of degradation,
what the other part of <i>America</i> yields naturally in
the most perfect state!</p>

<p>In regard to industry, can it be feared that
the <i>South Americans, even supposing them independent</i>,
should be tempted to import rough materials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
from <i>Europe</i>, in order to have them wrought
by <i>American hands, which are so naturally and so
profitably employed in the production of American
articles</i>? Is it even to be feared that they should
aim at a competition with the <i>Europeans</i> in the
exportation of <i>American</i> articles, when they are
in need of ship-timber, or rather when in this,
much more than in any other respects, there is
no <i>European</i> work, which, if done in <i>America</i>,
would not cost three times as much as when imported
from <i>Europe</i>?—All <i>European</i> prejudices,
relative to commerce, are founded on the following
principle, which may be looked upon as the
<i>quintessence</i> of the Navigation-Act:—<i>To do every
thing ourselves, in order that no one’s assistance
may be wanted,—that no one may do without our
assistance,—and that no assistance be given, but at
the prices prescribed by the Lords of the Seas.</i>—The
Navigation-Act was, without doubt, the last
effort of the human mind about the middle of
the 17th century<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span></p>

<p>It seems to me, that the only point which
essentially concerns all <i>Europe</i>, in regard to
other parts of the world, where she can give
law, would be to find out <i>what kind of Administration
would be the best calculated to increase in all
those parts the consumption of <span class="upright">European</span> goods,
and to procure to herself a more considerable stock
of foreign goods and products,—which would, as
they have ever done, give, <span class="upright">either directly or indirectly</span>,
a fresh encouragement to her agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
and manufactures</i>. Let any one examine, whether
the utility of the colonies be not strictly
confined to this single point.</p>

<p>I speak of all <i>Europe</i>, it is true, as if she
formed but one State, whilst she is supposed to
exhibit so many interests, and these so very opposite
to each other. This question deserves a
deeper discussion than I am able to give it;
yet I presume to think that the answer I could
give, might be susceptible of demonstration, had
we, on all the countries in <i>Europe</i>, statements
only similar to those which Sir <i>Charles Whitworth</i>
has given of the <i>British</i> trade, and were
we to add thereto the means and faculties which
are to be met with in <i>England</i> of procuring the details
and proofs of every particular that concerns
the public. Destitute however of an advantage
so precious, so worthy of a nation sufficiently
enlightened to dread nothing but being left in
the dark on any part of her own interests, of
a nation judicious enough not to disdain a ray
of light, from whatever quarter it may come,
and generous enough to perceive, with pleasure,
that by enriching herself, she has, to this
day, enriched all <i>Europe</i>;—</p>

<p>If it were admitted, that money is only the
representation of value; that multiplying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
sign, without multiplying the articles which it
is calculated to represent, is debasing fruitlessly
the representation; and that, on the contrary,
multiplying the article is the most infallible
means of attracting the sign and keeping it up to
its value:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that nothing contributes
so much to the multiplying of the articles,
as the multiplicity of the channels through
which they can be introduced:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that the multiplicity
of channels in another nation, for the introduction
of our own goods, is necessarily inseparable
from the multiplicity of channels opened in
our own country for the introduction of foreign
goods:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that with the fullest
persuasion that money ought to be the sole aim
of trade, it has only proved, hitherto, the means
of supporting it:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that notwithstanding
the prejudices to the contrary, as deeply rooted
in the heads of Ministers, as they are in the hearts
of Merchants, and notwithstanding all the national
cupidities, private interest in all countries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
has always proved sufficient to reject effectually
all the <i>useless</i>, and procure all the <i>necessary</i>
money:</p>

<p>If it should result, not from arguments, which
very seldom contain what they ought to contain,
in order to become uncontrovertible, but from
the experience of a whole century, sufficient to
estimate the effect of the passion the most ardent,
and the most attached to its object, that contrary
to the common ideas, and in spite of the general
rage for money, the whole of commerce has, to
this day, been ultimately confined to <i>its true balance</i>,
i. e. <i>to bartering goods for goods</i>, except the
little money which is wanted every where, and
which has constantly penetrated every where, to
answer either to the new productions when they had
actually increased in their quantity, or to the advance
of prices when the taxes had at last produced
every where, and on the generality of prices, their
effect, as equitable as it is necessary and harmless:</p>

<p>If the same experience should evince, that the
richest individual, or he who becomes such
the soonest, has no other advantage in point
of commerce, than the choice of the men
whom he is pleased to admit to a share of
his wealth without impairing it; and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
inference to be drawn therefrom is, <i>that such
a man must be a dupe who confines his choice to
ten, when he can make it from among thirty</i>:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that riches and ease,
like the light, stand in want of no assistance whatever,
to propagate themselves equally in every
direction, <i>as general interest requires</i>; that the
private interest of one man, or of a body of men,
is always sufficiently opposed, protected, balanced,
by the interest of another man, or of another body
of men, <i>wherever administration confines its attention
to the maintenance of strict justice and good order</i>;
and that from this equilibrium in which they
mutually keep, or soon replace one another, there
results, for both, the greatest advantage they
can hope for, and for the State the highest prosperity
it can attain:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that on all these various
objects, no difference whatever can subsist
between one nation and another:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged also, that all <i>Europe</i>,
as well as each State in particular, is essentially,
finally, strictly, composed only of three kinds
of <i>capitalists</i>, or proprietors, the <i>landed capitalist,
the capitalist of industry, and the proprietor
of money</i>, considered either as a dependant
or as a <i>capitalist</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span></p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that those three interests
center in the greatest quantity, as well as
the greatest variety and best quality, of the products
both of agriculture and industry, and in
the greatest consumption of both at the most
reasonable rate:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that the <i>Fisc</i>, or
Exchequer, owes the whole of its revenue to the
produce of the taxes only; and that this produce
rising of course as the productions and consumption
increase, the interest of the Exchequer can
no where be different from that of the three
capitalists or proprietors:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that <i>at present</i> nothing
can result from several institutions, pretended
very wise, but a great diminution in the
products and consumption, as well as in the revenue
of the Exchequer; because there is nothing
so easy as to balance, every where, institutions
pretended very wise, by others not less so:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that the <i>necessary</i>
expenditure of the Exchequer once ascertained,
all diminution of its revenue, occasioned by the
pretended very wise institutions, carries with it
the necessity of imposing new taxes, in order to
make up the <i>deficit</i> of former ones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span></p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that each new tax,
increasing necessarily the price of every thing in
the nation, <i>for the purpose of supporting, at least,
the interior consumption, on which depends the discharge
of the taxes</i>, would add to the inconvenience
brought about by those pretended very
wise regulations, <i>and would soon lead to a decrease
in the external consumption, which the nation
might have preserved</i>, if other countries did not
raise their own prices accordingly, in order to
pay with the same products the same quantity of
articles which they used to take before the advance
occasioned by the taxes; that therefore
such a general propagation of increase in prices,
being of a general interest to the production and
consumption every where, would not fail to take
place every where as it has always done, and to
dwindle again into a childish play, much beneath
the adolescence of the age we live in:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that the general repeal
of those pretended very wise institutions
could, at the worst, be productive of no other
effect <i>within the State</i>, but that of a general rise
in the prices, wherever they are not in due proportion
to the real values, and a general fall in
all the prices, wherever they are fixed by monopoly,
and not by the natural equilibrium; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
that, whereas nothing but profit can accrue to
those who raise their prices, it is very probable
that the prices would increase much more almost
<i>every where</i>, than they would decrease <i>any
where</i>:</p>

<p>If it were, besides, acknowledged that such
an increase, or decrease, (it matters not which)
soon becoming general and proportionate, (without
any other agent to work that miracle, but
that reciprocal pressure which establishes a perfect
symmetry in a bee-hive,) then no alteration could
arise therefrom in the circumstances of the two
essential capitalists, since it is perfectly indifferent
whether we purchase the labour of others at
5 or 6 <i>per cent.</i> dearer, if we sell our own labour
in proportion:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that in regard to
the money proprietor, <i>whether dependant or capitalist</i>,
nothing can result from it but the certainty
of procuring henceforth and for ever, at
the most equitable price, that which he had paid
for hitherto according to the rate set on it by
monopoly, and often by a scarcity cunningly
prepared and managed:</p>

<p>If it were acknowledged, that <i>as to the external
interests of the State</i>, no other effect can result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
from the general repeal of those pretended
very wise institutions, but the facilitating of all the
branches of foreign correspondence, the opening of
new channels of consumption, the encouragement
of all kinds of production, of which consumption
is the very soul, and the power of obtaining
every where, at the most equitable prices, <i>by
means of competition</i>, the most equitable share we
have a right to expect in those gifts which nature,
in all probability, has not bestowed on any part
of the world, to confine them to that particular
spot:</p>

<p>If all the foregoing points, I say, were acknowledged,
it would be a hard matter to
conceive that there is, not only in <i>Europe</i>, but
all over the globe, any other enemy to destroy
but Monopoly, or any other interest to favour
but Labour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading42">PRÉFACE<br>
<i>DE L’ÉDITEUR</i>.</h2>

</div>

<p>Ce n’est point un <i>Traité</i> que l’Auteur annonce:
ce n’est rien de plus que des <i>Considérations
sur le Méchanisme des Sociétés</i>. Un pareil
titre n’astreint point à un plan régulier, &amp; sauve
même le risque de préparer les Lecteurs à un
enchaînement d’idées qui n’échappera point à
leur sagacité, s’il existe; &amp; sur lequel on ne
les abuseroit point, s’il n’existe pas. Mais dans
un tableau consacré au monde comme à la patrie,
aux peuples comme à leurs maîtres, il falloit
que l’objet saillant, l’objet sur lequel on dirigeoit
leur première attention, fût d’un intérêt
assez général pour les engager progressivement
à l’examen de tous ceux de ses détails qui
méritent d’être approfondis, &amp; dont les rapports
sont méconnus ou mal jugés.</p>

<p>L’objet qui fixe aujourd’hui l’attention de
tous les États de l’<i>Europe</i>, tous débiteurs &amp;
créanciers, c’est la dette publique de l’<i>Angleterre</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
&amp; les mesures que va prendre à ce sujet,
l’Assemblée du monde la plus éclairée sur les
intérêts du peuple, la plus jalouse de ses droits,
&amp; la plus libre du moins dans ses débats. C’est
par l’examen de cette formidable dette, &amp; de
son influence sur la richesse de l’État &amp; l’aisance
du peuple, que l’Auteur ose commencer. Mais
avant d’en expliquer le méchanisme, dont le
résultat présente des idées trop contraires à
l’opinion générale, l’Auteur tàche de familiariser
peu à peu ses Lecteurs avec la sienne, par
des <i>Réflexions générales sur la situation actuelle
de l’<span class="upright">Angleterre</span></i>; ces réflexions ne lui permettant
pas de douter, que la nation ne fût en
1779, malgré la dette nationale, plus riche
qu’au commencement du siècle, du quadruple,
ou du double seulement, suivant le calcul de
population auquel on sera le plus attaché.—On
voit que l’Auteur, relativement à son plan,
n’attache aucune importance à la différence des
opinions sur cet article.</p>

<p><i>Une vue plus particulière du sujet</i>, présente à
l’Auteur de nouvelles raisons qui lui paroissent
capables de tranquilliser le créancier le plus
inquiet.—Ce n’est à la vérité que par le moyen
<i>des épargnes</i> faites &amp; à faire journellement sur
8 sols, portion exacte qui revient à chaque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
individu dans le revenu général, qu’on a pu
parvenir à l’opulence, &amp; qu’il est possible de
s’y maintenir; mais l’Auteur cherche <i>les épargnes</i>
qu’on ne peut méconnoître dans l’agriculture
&amp; dans l’industrie: il trouve que celles
de l’agriculture ont suffi depuis un siècle, non-seulement
pour satisfaire aux charges publiques,
mais encore pour doubler le revenu territorial;
&amp; il détaille ensuite une quantité d’objets, faciles
à vérifier, qui semblent démontrer le même
progrès dans l’industrie.</p>

<p>Ici l’Auteur commence à se croire assez ferme
sur son terrein, pour convenir qu’il ne voit rien
dans la situation actuelle de l’<i>Angleterre</i> qui
puisse justifier l’idée d’une banqueroute, quoique
les papiers publics de cette nation en insinuent
très-souvent la commodité. L’Auteur
s’oublie même jusqu’à examiner sérieusement,
<i>s’il seroit avantageux de rembourser ou de ne pas
rembourser, même dans la supposition que les 238
millions empruntés &amp; disparus, reparoîtroient dans
les coffres de l’Échiquier</i>.</p>

<p>Après avoir présenté la question sous plusieurs
points de vue, l’Auteur n’hésite point à se
décider pour la négative, &amp; tâche ensuite de prouver
qu’une <i>Thésaurisation</i> antérieure qui eût mis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
la Nation en état de soutenir la dernière guerre
sans imposer aucune taxe additionelle, auroit
fait beaucoup plus de mal que les nouvelles
taxes n’ont été capables d’en faire.</p>

<p>L’Auteur devenu plus hardi, parce que personne
ne le contredit lorsqu’il est seul (&amp; en
vérité il est seul bien souvent), entreprend de
réconcilier le genre humain avec les taxes, au
moyen d’une première décomposition de l’impôt;
il abandonne à la vérité une de ses parties
comme onéreuse, (il est fâcheux réellement
qu’elle soit indispensable, heureusement c’est la
moindre;) mais il défend hautement l’autre partie,
comme une ressource très-précieuse pour
cette portion du peuple qui mérite le plus de
captiver l’intérêt du Gouvernement.</p>

<p>Malgré toutes les précautions que l’Auteur
a prises jusqu’ici pour ne pas effaroucher ses
Lecteurs, il lui reste un tel pas à franchir, qu’on
le voit presque à genoux pour supplier qu’on
lui permette de le franchir en vingt fois s’il n’y
réussit pas en dix; c’est-à-dire, qu’il desire
beaucoup que son Ouvrage ne soit pas condamné
<i>définitivement</i>, avant d’avoir été lu jusqu’à
la fin; en effet il n’est pas impossible qu’une proposition
détachée, dont le ridicule est frappant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
à l’exposition, devienne cependant très-raisonnable
lorsqu’elle aura été successivement rapprochée
de toutes celles qui doivent la suivre.—</p>

<p>Un Editeur doit encore plus au Public qu’à
un Ouvrage auquel il seroit même assez flatté
de procurer une petite fortune; je crois donc
être obligé (<i>in foro conscientiæ</i>) de prévenir que
ce n’est qu’après avoir parcouru cinquante &amp;
quelques pages qu’on soupçonne pourquoi l’Auteur
n’a pas annoncé dès la première, les singularités
qu’il se proposoit insidieusement d’établir
pied à pied dans sa brochure: mais enfin
on peut alors pressentir ce qu’on doit attendre
d’un homme qui vient de conter <i>que les taxes
ne sont qu’un petit mal, que la Thésaurisation
en seroit un très-grand, qu’un remboursement est
au moins inutile</i>,—&amp; qui aussi-tôt annonce
modestement qu’il pourra bien, <i>par la suite</i>, lui
échapper quelques bizarreries,—comme s’il pouvoit
y en avoir de plus complettes que les trois
propositions dont je viens de rendre compte.</p>

<p>Cependant il ne faut pas être trop sévère;—le
Lecteur a-t-il été seulement amusé par le coin
du Tableau jusques-là découvert?—qu’il se
prête à la petite manie de l’Auteur; on renonceroit
à montrer des curiosités, si l’on n’avoit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
pas la liberté de lever le rideau à sa fantaisie,
si l’on n’avoit pas le droit de ne montrer, à
chaque annonce, que la petite partie de la
curiosité, sur laquelle on veut fixer pour le
moment les yeux du Spectateur:—</p>

<p>Mais si le Lecteur n’a pas encore observé la
moindre variation dans le compas malgré la
différence des positions; s’il n’a pas été un peu
ébranlé par les raisonnemens dont on l’aura
bercé jusqu’alors,—qu’il jette la brochure au
feu; car l’Auteur, dont je ne prétends point
imiter la circonspection, ou adopter les craintes,
ou justifier l’audace, ou partager le délit, n’entreprend
rien moins que d’engager <i>toute l’Europe</i>,
(toute Europe!) à examiner:</p>

<p class="center">1ᵒ.</p>

<p>S’il seroit possible qu’il en coutât à l’<i>Angleterre</i>
au-delà de 5 millions sterling, <i>une fois
trouvés</i>, pour assurer, <i>à perpétuité</i>, de la façon
la plus solide, le paiement de l’intérêt d’une
dette de 238 millions, cet intérêt fixé à 9 millions
même monnoie.</p>

<p class="center">2ᵒ.</p>

<p>S’il n’y a pas sans qu’on l’imagine, dans le
Systême de Finance de l’<i>Angleterre</i>, quelquesunes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
des imperfections si bien observées, si justement,
si amèrement critiquées dans celui de
la <i>France</i>; &amp; si un remboursement national
n’est pas le plus facile de tous les jeux avec lesquels
un Ministre de Finance peut amuser la
Société, sans la servir.</p>

<p class="center">3ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si la possibilité d’une balance de commerce
toujours favorable, n’est pas aussi douteuse que
la nécessité d’une banqueroute, &amp; l’avantage
d’un remboursement.</p>

<p class="center">4ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si l’équilibre en tout &amp; par tout, n’est pas indispensable;
&amp; si, pour maintenir ou rétablir cet
équilibre, il faut de grands efforts d’imagination
de la part de ceux qui croient tenir la balance.</p>

<p class="center">5ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si la différence des prix est quelque chose ou
rien; &amp; s’il a fallu en <i>France</i> au-delà de 66 millions
tournois, <i>une fois trouvés</i>, pour assurer, <i>à
jamais</i>, l’intérêt à 5 p. cent d’un emprunt national
de 1500 millions.</p>

<p class="center">6ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si le monstre d’une concurrence en fait de
commerce, prétendue invincible graces à la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
légèreté des prix dont elle seroit armée, n’est
pas aussi fantastique que celui d’une balance
toujours favorable.</p>

<p class="center">7ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si le <i>præmium</i> d’exportation le plus pardonnable,
est autre chose qu’une injustice devenue
nécessaire pour en balancer une infinité d’autres.</p>

<p class="center">8ᵒ.</p>

<p>S’il ne résulte pas du rétablissement toujours
infaillible &amp; purement méchanique de l’équilibre
dans tous les prix, que les taxes sont d’une
innocence absolue en elles-mêmes;—s’il est au-delà
d’une espèce de taxation, qui n’augmente
la masse générale des prix que du montant précis
de la taxe;—si toutes les autres n’en triplent
pas l’effet;—si la plus pernicieuse, <i>après la capitation</i>,
n’est pas celle <i>du luxe</i>;—&amp; si du moment
où toutes les taxes <i>bonnes ou mauvaises</i>, ont
réagi sur tout, le fardeau de la dette nationale
n’est pas évidemment <span class="smcap">nul</span> dans tous les pays.</p>

<p class="center">9ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si le crédit n’est pas, <i>après le Monopole</i>, l’effet
de la richesse qui enchérisse le plus tous les
produits de la terre &amp; de l’industrie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p class="center">10ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si tel pays où la contrebande fut défendue
sous peine des galères, ne doit pas <i>à la contrebande</i>
un cinquième des produits de son agriculture,
dont le commerce profite avec aussi peu
de scrupule que s’il n’eût pas sollicité la loi
abominable contre les contrebandiers.</p>

<p class="center">11ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si l’absurdité de l’idée générale sur le moyen
le plus propre pour établir une concurrence
avantageuse en fait de commerce, n’est pas démontrée
par l’Histoire d’une révolution singulière
en <i>France</i>; révolution aussi peu douteuse
que les deux guerres de 1755 &amp; de 1779.</p>

<p class="center">12ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si l’impossibilité des deux balances prétendues
par la <i>France</i> &amp; par l’<i>Angleterre</i>, n’est pas
prouvée par les faits allégués dans les deux
pays pour établir l’existence de ces deux monstres;—si
cette impossibilité n’est pas démontrée
par d’autres faits aussi peu équivoques;—&amp; s’il
n’est pas de l’intérêt de l’<i>Angleterre</i> &amp; de la
<i>France</i>, d’abjurer au plus tôt l’idole, &amp; de renoncer
authentiquement à ses œuvres comme à ses
pompes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span></p>

<p class="center">13ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si les exportations &amp; importations ne sont pas
un jeu aussi innocent que celui de la paume;
un jeu néanmoins dont tous les Gouvernemens
pourroient tirer un grand parti, tous les sujets
un grand avantage, &amp; tous les États un accroissement
de force &amp; de richesse.</p>

<p class="center">14ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si la généralité des exportations de l’<i>Angleterre</i>
en différens périodes, considérée relativement
à la correspondance étrangère, ne démontre
pas une espèce d’électricité dont on n’avoit
pas encore l’idée, &amp; qui n’est pas indigne d’amuser
le loisir des plus grands Politiques.</p>

<p class="center">15ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si le badinage du luxe n’est pas aussi innocent
que le jeu des exportations &amp; importations; &amp;
combien le plus fastueux, le plus prodigue, le
plus sensuel de tous les Princes, consomme au-delà
du plus avare de ses sujets.</p>

<p class="center">16ᵒ.</p>

<p>Combien, en négligeant les sols &amp; les deniers,
l’<i>Angleterre</i> a perdu en perdant ce qu’on appelloit
son bras droit; &amp; combien, en négligeant
les sols &amp; les deniers, toute l’<i>Europe</i> perdroit si
elle perdoit la souveraineté des deux <i>Amériques</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>

<p class="center">17ᵒ.</p>

<p>Si tout ce qui avoit paru à l’Auteur fondé en
raison &amp; en justice, ne se trouve pas finalement,
en dépit de la conjuration générale de tous les
Peuples &amp; de tous les Ministres, conforme aux
faits les plus douteux;—&amp; s’il ne résulte pas
de la réunion des faits &amp; des raisons, que l’assertion
de l’Auteur la plus intéressante pour
l’humanité, c’est-à-dire pour tous les Princes
comme pour tous les Peuples, est de la vérité
la plus incontestable, &amp; la plus facile à mettre
à la portée de tous les intéressés.</p>

<p>J’irai plus loin quoique Editeur. Je supposerai
qu’il résultât aussi de cette réunion de
raisons &amp; de faits, que les moyens qu’on a
crus jusqu’ici les plus propres à soulager le
Peuple, étoient les plus infaillibles pour le
vexer; qu’est ce que cela fait au Peuple pourvu
qu’on ne le vexe plus? Le passé est-il autre
chose qu’un songe?</p>

<p>Je supposerai encore qu’il en résultât qu’on
n’a jamais travaillé plus solidement à diminuer
les revenus du Prince, que lorsqu’on s’est flatté
de les augmenter; qu’est-ce que cela fait au
Prince, pourvu qu’il ne soit plus possible de se<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
méprendre sur les vrais moyens de l’enrichir?
N’est-ce pas de l’avenir sur tout, qu’un grand
Prince doit s’occuper?</p>

<p>Je supposerai encore qu’il en résultât qu’on
a eu grand tort de s’imaginer qu’il falloit diminuer
le revenu du Peuple pour augmenter
celui du Prince; qu’est-ce que cela fait au
Prince &amp; au Peuple, pourvu qu’ils soient
l’un &amp; l’autre bien convaincus qu’il n’est pas
possible d’enrichir l’un, sans enrichir l’autre
de la même manière, &amp; dans la même proportion?</p>

<p>Je supposerai encore qu’il en résultât évidemment
qu’il n’y a pas eu jusqu’ici dans les
finances d’aucun pays, un seul principe, une
seule idée qui en méritât le nom; qu’est-ce que
cela fait aux Ministres qui dirigent aujourd’hui
les finances? Le passé est-il à leurs ordres?
Et n’est-ce pas dans la rectification des abus
découverts, que consiste la vraie gloire d’un
Ministère?</p>

<p>Je supposerai même, pour combler la mesure,
qu’il en résultât pour un très-simple individu
<i>Américain</i>, une petite branche de cet arbuste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
<i>Européen</i> qu’on appelle laurier femelle; qu’est-ce
que cela fait à tous les Ministres, à tous
les Peuples, à tous les Princes de l’<i>Europe</i>?
L’<i>Amérique</i> consommera-t-elle moins de marchandises
<i>Européennes</i>, &amp; produira-t-elle moins
d’or &amp; d’argent, pour avoir produit une idée?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The 18 millions sterling in circulation, as calculated
in 1688, by Dr. <i>Davenant</i>, were, in 1711, brought down
to 12 millions, probably as we reduce now to 20 or 25, the
40 millions and upwards which might be supposed in
<i>England</i>, were we to confine ourselves to the calculation
of the coin struck in the present reign, and of the old pieces
preserved on account of their weight being unimpaired.
The sequel will shew, that it is next to an impossibility
for a country, tolerably governed, to preserve, for any
length of time, more or less money than its wants require.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> I have mentioned the fatal tree, as a consequence of
the miseries attending war. This is more sensibly felt
in <i>England</i> than any where else, for reasons obvious to
every one. During the first years that immediately follow
a peace, a four-fold number of wretches, to what
are executed at other times, are brought to the gallows.
It is with much ado that a man returns within the sphere
of the confined and daily occupations of the handicrafts
or husbandmen, when he has for some years rioted in that
licentiousness permitted, in a manner, to soldiers and
sailors, in every thing that does not concern their respective
service.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> This idea is the more to be attended to, as, supposing
it were possible that an increase of coin, within
the nation, should enhance the produce of industry alone,
the landed proprietors would certainly be obliged to
petition for an act of parliament, <i>prohibiting the importation
of bullion, for fear it should be turned into coin</i>; just
as they would be obliged to pray for a tax on the productions
of the earth, if none but the taxed articles were
to increase in price.—We now petition against taxes;
we should then pray to be taxed. This would be no
bad subject for a Comedy, if attempted by a writer who
would handle it properly. I hope the labouring man
would be allotted a very bustling part; that is, he would
engross the best wishes of all good men, and command the
attention of all those who do not think themselves entitled
to that appellation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Since my writing the above I have seen the account-book

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Under the idea of labour, I comprise all kinds of capitals
necessary to keep in action the labouring man; a stock,

former labours, whether it represents the savings of a certain
number of years, in regard to one man, or those of

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> One of the most respectable <i>English</i> writers has been
charged with having entirely given up the <i>American</i> cause,
which he had hitherto so strenuously supported; in my
opinion it is a mistake. It was not to the <i>Americans</i> that
the Doctor was attached, it was to certain maxims, plain
but fertile, by which they seemed to have been directed,
and which the said author, establishes and recommends as
the only guides for all Princes and Nations, to lead them
to that point of prosperity the limits of which can be
prescribed by Nature alone; the <i>Americans</i> most probably
will return to those maxims, and I presume to think, that
they will instantly be restored to the favour of that worthy
Divine; my opinions so nearly approach to those of that
honest man on every point that truly concerns society,
that I wish either to convert him, or to be perverted by
him, with regard to the reimbursement. I must confess,
that if the ideas which are the ground-work of my principles,
be false, the error is mine alone; if I am right,
the mistake of the Doctor, (like the imperfections in <i>Shakespeare</i>),
is the fault of his age, not of himself. I shall further
add, that the reimbursement, according to the principles
I have laid down, is not a measure by any means material
to the State; it is only a trifling injustice done to very
little purpose, and not even suspected by those who sustain
it, a <i>je ne sais quoi</i> giving to one a little credit and a little
uneasiness to others, keeping <i>the bulls and bears</i> in spirits
and the writers of paragraphs in full employ, but luckily
productive of a light and transitory sensation only, and
even that in a small part of the machine: so little is reimbursed
at a time! so soon is one tired of reimbursing!
Presently, the only essential object, the price of every
thing shapes itself so well by the circumstances attending
the reimbursement, that I should not hesitate to ascribe the
ordinary, the infallible reparation of all evil, to the credit
of one sole principle of all good, were it not my invariable
maxim (as it is the Doctor’s and his friend <i>M. Turgot</i>’s)
not to scandalise even those who do not believe in God.</p>

<p>There is a prejudice much more unaccountable in <i>England</i>,
in the proud <i>England</i>, than the whim of a national
reimbursement; it is that prejudice which all the <i>hired</i>
writers, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, endeavour to propagate from age to
age in all countries, a prejudice, on the destroying of which
every unhired writer can never be too intent, that prejudice
stating, that <i>the prosperity of a State depends on one single individual</i>.
Where is that <i>Phœnix</i> to be found? There are always
two pretenders at least, who cry at once, <span class="smcap">I am the
man</span>, and a thousand voices exclaiming together, <span class="smcap">he is
the man</span>. <i>The prosperity of a State, be its extent what it
may, solely depends on its agriculture, its industry, its knowledge,
and on that degree of liberty with which those three objects
can exert themselves in every way.</i> This is the grand
truth which ought to be impressed on every mind.⸺Let
one great man die in a country where great men are appreciated⸺stamp
on the ground, and ten such men will start
up: many more will start up when every body, without
respect either to face or mask, is at liberty to stand as a candidate.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Let the question on this very point be asked of any
one, who can remember, and compare. I except no article
whatsoever of industry, which is brought to perfection.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> It is truly farcical to hear and <i>see</i> the deep-fetched
sigh of a tradesman, when he is reminded by a purchaser,
that the subject matter of the bargain is dearer than it
used to be: “Alas! Sir, (says he) this very article is
taxed one shilling; and, Sir, I say nothing of that
cursed shop-tax.” But <i>why</i>? If the purchaser has
some kind of labour, no matter what, and no matter how,
to dispose of, it is evident that, as soon as the sigh will
have gone round, the tax will be paid, <i>without any expence
but that of some thousands of sighs exchanged by the community
at large</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> I must confess I wish also that a little time could be
spared to examine whether all kinds of taxes, already devised
or to be devised, already established or to be established,
on any other object but <i>consumption</i>, whatever may
be the appellation with which they may be honoured or disgraced,
from the land-tax down to the shop-tax, <i>are not in
fact so many poll-taxes</i>:—that is to say, I wish they would
be pleased to examine, whether that man whose <i>hand</i> is
obliged, <i>under pain of distress</i>, to give at such a day such
a sum, can, upon due recollection, disguise to himself
that his <i>head</i> is as really taxed, as if the subsidy to be
paid was called <i>a poll-tax</i>, or <i>la taille</i>. If I am not
mistaken, the case is this: the shopkeeper feels that he
ought not to pay a tax upon his shop; he pays it and
cries out like an eagle; he is right: the land proprietor
does not know that he ought not to pay a tax upon
his land; he pays it and says nothing; he is wrong: the
Minister wanted money; he thought that nothing remained
untaxed; he suspected that the land proprietor would at
last cry out as loud as the shopkeeper, if the land-tax was
increased; he taxed the shops: a shop, in truth, does not
appear (very evidently at least) more sacred than the land
upon which it is erected.—It is not at all impossible, but
that in some few years all these misunderstandings will be
talked of with as little reverence as witchcraft; but till
then, the good mother Nature must work underhand, as
she ever did, and probably ever will.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> In the Political Arithmetic of Mr. <i>Young</i>, may be
seen the accounts, year by year, whence I have drawn
the inferences here submitted to the Reader. It is but a
few days ago that I thought of comparing with my own
ideas the result of the whole of those accounts.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> It is a very good idea, according to the Navigation-Act,
to restrain, as much as possible, the <i>English</i> sugar-colonies,
<i>which their strongest interests attach for ever to
England</i>,—to restrain, I say, those sugar-colonies, in order
to enlarge the faculties of some relics of timber, tar, and
wheat-colonies, <i>which their strongest interests will detach
from <span class="upright">England</span> as soon as</i> they shall be strong enough to
make the best of their timber, tar, and wheat. It is said
in <i>England</i>, that the sugar-cane planters are so immensely
rich, that they can well afford to pay 20 <i>per cent.</i> dearer
to their <i>dutiful</i> brethren, for what they could purchase
20 <i>per cent.</i> cheaper from their <i>revolted</i> ones.—A
sugar-cane planter, with a clear revenue of one or ten
thousand pounds sterling in sugar, is neither more nor less
rich than a freeholder in <i>Great-Britain</i>, with a clear revenue
of one or ten thousand pounds sterling in wheat or
grass; the one, as well as the other, is every day rich by
the 2 or 4 pounds weight of food he can digest, and
by the 6 or 10 or 15 <i>lb.</i> of cloaths he can wear; the
one, as well as the other, picks out those 10 or 20 pounds
from the materials that best suit his taste or fancy.—To the
shame of thy power, ô Opulence, here thou must stop! <i>huc
usque venies</i>.—Such is the truth, no greater is the truth, no
less trivial is the truth, before which that <i>great globe itself</i>,
that immense and <i>baseless fabric</i> of premiums, prohibitions,
restrictions, and so many other financiering <i>visions</i>—<i>shall
dissolve, and leave not a wreck behind</i>!</p>
